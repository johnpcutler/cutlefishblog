It’s easy to unconsciously exude frustration and an air of superiority, even when you’re “just trying to help”, and then slip into a cycle of increasing frustration as things stay the same. The frustration may not have been real at first, but it <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">becomes</em> real.</p><p name="67d1" id="67d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s this last part that I’m particularly interested in.</p><h3 name="b164" id="b164" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Did It Work?</h3><p name="157c" id="157c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">When we run small experiments in product development, we look for evidence that the intervention is, indeed, working. I wish I could say the same for my various efforts at change over the years (and those of folks I have worked with). It’s hard to see the writing on the wall for some reason — perhaps because we become deeply vested in improving our work environments, believe strongly in the fix and low-hanging-fruitedness, or receive <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">just enough</em> positive confirmation from <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">some</em> (but not all) of our teammates. And at some point it <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">does</em> get personal. It develops into a you (or us) vs. them situation, and this is a problem.</p><p name="26aa" id="26aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was speaking to an executive recently who had been previously critical of team members for being pessimistic, antagonistic, and obstructionist.</p><blockquote name="27e0" id="27e0" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">I noticed that I was starting to act like them (the team members), and it freaked me out.

So…right or not, when what we’re trying isn’t working…well, it isn’t working.</p><p name="7a9b" id="7a9b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is easy to frame this as fixed vs. growth mindset (<a href="https://www.thecut.com/2017/01/mindset-theory-a-popular-idea-in-education-may-be-trouble.html" data-href="https://www.thecut.com/2017/01/mindset-theory-a-popular-idea-in-education-may-be-trouble.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently under fire</a>), change resistance/risk aversion, office politics, a power-hungry manager, Theory X vs. Theory Y, pathological vs. bureaucratic vs. generative (Westrum), and good old “they just don’t understand!” Frame away. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The reality remains: what you’re trying isn’t working.

How can you advocate while avoiding the burnout, lost months/years, and damaged work relationships? How can you give it an “solid try”, stay if things improve, and go gracefully if things don’t?</p><p name="244a" id="244a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let’s get back to the idea of running experiments (or as <a href="https://medium.com/u/b29cb8a5ba65" data-href="https://medium.com/u/b29cb8a5ba65" data-anchor-type="2" data-user-id="b29cb8a5ba65" data-action-value="b29cb8a5ba65" data-action="show-user-card" data-action-type="hover" class="markup--user markup--p-user" target="_blank">Dave Snowden </a>likes to call them <a href="http://cognitive-edge.com/methods/safe-to-fail-probes/" data-href="http://cognitive-edge.com/methods/safe-to-fail-probes/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Safe to Fail Probes</a>). Part of the challenge here is that it is often not easy to sense these issues before joining a company. We all put our best foot forward when hiring (and being hired). But “probes” can start before you join the company with <a href="https://medium.com/u/a39c61f8b573" data-href="https://medium.com/u/a39c61f8b573" data-anchor-type="2" data-user-id="a39c61f8b573" data-action-value="a39c61f8b573" data-action="show-user-card" data-action-type="hover" class="markup--user markup--p-user" target="_blank">Glassdoor</a> stalking, ex-employee conversations, and interviewer questions. Are you aligned with how the company works? Have you zeroed in on the current warts? Is your role an aspirational role — one that is desired, but not necessarily supported — or a role that has been successful in the past? Does your manager-to-be share your views on advocacy, continuous improvement, and transparency? These questions take self-awareness, so I would suggest some journaling, checking our <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Your-Life-Well-Lived-Joyful/dp/1101875321" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Your-Life-Well-Lived-Joyful/dp/1101875321" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Designing Your Life</a>, and perhaps reviewing the situations and loops that have sapped your energy in the past.</p><p name="dc75" id="dc75" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At a minimum, ask someone:</p><blockquote name="ce30" id="ce30" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Can you describe an elephant in the room that I will quickly encounter, will think is totally fixable, but will be wrong? Why is the status quo difficult to change?</blockquote><p name="8a0b" id="8a0b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">If you join, it is time to take stock. You will immediately find entrenched problems. It is safe to say that all organizations have them (though some seem to have fewer chronic issues, and deal with acute problems more quickly and effectively). A good rule is that if you find something unquestionably toxic or uncomfortable…just leave. Certain things never get better. If they were allowed to exist/persist, that’s a big warning sign. You don’t even need to mention the job on your resume (if you’re afraid of being pegged a job hopper).</p><h3 name="2053" id="2053" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Shut Up For Three Months</h3><p name="29de" id="29de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Say there are no toxic elephants, but just your run of the mill “low hanging fruit” (which we know is rarely low hanging). Your next step is to shut up for three months. No reply-alls, no “have you tried….”, and no “oh that’s easy to fix”. Hold your cards. Just observe and write a daily journal for 5–10 minutes each day.</p><p name="764b" id="764b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Considering the following questions:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="993c" id="993c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">What forces are holding the problem in place?</li><li name="d80e" id="d80e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Who benefits from the status quo?

Amplify the stuff that works. Dampen the stuff that doesn’t. The hard part, however, is knowing what “works” really looks like. This is where I’ve led myself astray in the past. When something is truly “working”, you’ll know it:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="f0a9" id="f0a9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">People will invite you to meetings to talk about it, and learn more about it</li><li name="1e70" id="1e70" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Other parts of the organization will adopt it</li><li name="78fe" id="78fe" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">You’ll have volunteers to help you grow the idea</li><li name="fd47" id="fd47" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Someone will try to take credit for it (a good sign)</li><li name="79e6" id="79e6" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">People will reach out to thank you</li><li name="c820" id="c820" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">It will grow organically and virally</li></ul><p name="e90e" id="e90e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">You will sense the momentum and excitement.

I suggest using a self-assessment, and perhaps finding a friend to act as an accountability partner. For the self-assessment, consider some statements like:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="c3fc" id="c3fc" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">I am learning and growing in this role</li><li name="2e2e" id="2e2e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">I am seeing concrete signs of progress against the major problems that impact me</li><li name="ed3c" id="ed3c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">I would stay here, even if offered a 10% raise for a job at another company with a guarantee that switching jobs would be impact my career</li><li name="f4e0" id="f4e0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">I feel a sense of autonomy, mastery, and purpose here</li><li name="5323" id="5323" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">I feel supported</li><li name="3f79" id="3f79" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">I feel able to be myself here and stay true to what I value</li></ul><p name="2ec1" id="2ec1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Strongly Disagree | Disagree | Undecided | Agree | Strongly Agree</p><p name="8d26" id="8d26" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Set a concrete stay/leave goal…if your “score” remains undecided (or less) for an extended period of time (e.g three months), consider leaving at your twelve month mark.</strong> Use your accountability partner to stay grounded. I say this fully aware that the ability to change jobs is a luxury. At a minimum this should be a sign to start actively interviewing and seeing what else may be lurking out there.</p><p name="d366" id="d366" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By having a structured way to make the decision, you are less likely to get “sucked in” to a pattern of anger, frustration, etc. I’ve known people who stayed at jobs for years…always hoping things would turn around. It isn’t worth it.</p><h3 name="a59c" id="a59c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Rinse and Repeat — In Conclusion</h3><p name="da5a" id="da5a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">You’re not done at the twelve month mark. Keep at it. To repeat what I wrote above:</p><blockquote name="3008" id="3008" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">How can you advocate while avoiding the burnout, lost months/years, and damaged work relationships? How can you give it an “solid try”, stay if things improve, and go gracefully if things don’t?</blockquote><p name="399d" id="399d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The whole idea here is to never leave bitter, and never let yourself become your own worst enemy. Most people don’t want to “accept defeat”. But part of self-care is to know you did your best, acknowledge the complexity of the problems you face (even the “low hanging fruit”), and move on when the odds aren’t in your favor, and you lack autonomy/agency over the problem.</p><p name="4baa" id="4baa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You’ll need to drive this process. Most managers will not.</p><p name="f185" id="f185" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I had a manager once who shared the serenity prayer with me:</p><blockquote name="6e66" id="6e66" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">God grant me the serenity</blockquote><blockquote name="63a7" id="63a7" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">to accept the things I cannot change;</blockquote><blockquote name="7a59" id="7a59" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">courage to change the things I can;</blockquote><blockquote name="5dea" id="5dea" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">and wisdom to know the difference.</blockquote><p name="3335" id="3335" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">It angered me on a couple levels because it conveyed a level of permanence — a kind of “just accept it” attitude that isn’t really my style.

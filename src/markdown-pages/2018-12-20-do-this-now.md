I don’t write many prescriptive posts. This one will be different.

Do this…

Form a cross-functional, cross-team, hierarchy-spanning learning group in your company to focus, specifically, on *continuous improvement and change agency*. Meet regularly. Read papers/books. Invite speakers. Discuss the pressing challenges in your organization. Make it your mission to avoid buzz-phrases, silver bullets, cargo-cults, rebranded tools/frameworks/approaches, and reductionist thinking. Think — always — first principles. Don’t force this on anyone. Make your intention public, and see who shows up and sticks around. See [Liberating Structures ](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/)for some facilitation ideas if the group gets large.

*Note: I will gladly do a talk/AMA/activity with your group — ideally after a couple successful meetings. Hit me up on Twitter or here. I also recently crowd sourced this awesome change agent book list:*

[**70 Books (and Other Resources) for Internal Change Agents**  
*The response to this Tweet was amazing.*hackernoon.com](https://hackernoon.com/70-books-and-other-resources-for-internal-change-agents-bb3bcc4b347f "https://hackernoon.com/70-books-and-other-resources-for-internal-change-agents-bb3bcc4b347f")[](https://hackernoon.com/70-books-and-other-resources-for-internal-change-agents-bb3bcc4b347f)A current favorite is [Helping: How to Offer, Give, and Receive Help by Edgar Schein](https://www.amazon.com/Helping-Offer-Give-Receive-Help/dp/1605098566). It was extremely humbling and pointed out many flaws in my approach to helping.

Assuming you keep things purely theoretical (and don’t make waves), you’ll probably get away with this anywhere. **To reiterate, don’t threaten any institutions, policies, people, roles, titles, processes, or philosophies (yet)**. If someone gives you shit, then I suggest leaving the company. Something is wrong. If there is a policy against people meeting to self-improve how they work, or if this is viewed as a “waste of time”, then leave.

If more than a couple people show up, and you keep at it, you are likely going to attract *attention*. Learning, curiosity, camaraderie, and talking about challenges throws off energy, and energy/heat attracts attention. One group that will show immediate interest will be management. Why? Well, depending on the culture, many managers see this type of thinking as *their job*. They’ll get itchy. Even people talking about ideas is threatening, or at the very least represents something they need to keep an eye on, and potentially try to control/temper/guide.

What do you do when the managers — not the original group members, but the fast-followers — start to show up? Smile! Invite them in! They’ll likely just poke their head in long enough to see you as a non-threat (remember, they are super busy, and you’re making an effort not to threaten institutions), or they’ll stick around and perhaps become a powerful ally. If you want to filter out potential nagging threats…just make the reading/participation requirements super intense.

Is that it? Isn’t this a waste of time? If no change is happening, how can this be worth it?

First, by reaching across boundaries you will almost certainly see a cross pollination of ideas. That knowledge exchange alone can be worth it. You will start to inspire attendees to advocate for improvement experiments in their respective areas/bounded systems. Here I suggest adopting some sort of commitment as a group to conduct “safe to fail” experiments locally, and share back what you learn to the group. Don’t impose change. Invite people to give things a shot in your local experiments. Let the continuous improvement group members hold each other to accountable to make these experiments safe.

If you can keep things non-threatening, you’ll get a longer and longer leash (for lack of a better word). Actually, I suggest reading these two posts:

Software product development is hard.

Doing the hard work takes trust and safety. Without trust and safety, individuals and companies go into self-preservation mode. In these conditions we replace trust with process, and collaboration with control.

All companies have problems. The *best *companies prioritize the most threatening problems and deal with them. New ones pop up, and they keep dealing with them. Complexity creeps up, and they tame it. Everyone has faith that “the important things will get worked out”. Promises (especially the promises for support and respect) are kept. These companies hold entropy at bay, because if you fall too far behind, you’ll never dig yourself out of the hole.

To quote the great Greg Lemond:


> “It never gets easier, you just go faster.A lot of continuous improvement is just making it *possible* to do the hard work (the effective work) and face challenges when they arise.

Sharing a sample product development flow (the working pattern for my current team).

Something I’ve learned over the years…

**You have to TRY!**

Your team needs to *own its words and working agreements.* I’ve seen certified Scrum Masters (and Product Managers, Engineering Managers, and Developers) use the words, but not understand the first principles at play. Trying to paint-by-numbers is dangerous (in my honest opinion). So is assuming that you need to do every meeting — and every bit of process — to complete work.

I was talking to a friend the other day. Referring to their particular strengths/weaknesses, they said the following (paraphrasing):


> I’m extremely sensitive to problems and system dynamics. But the trouble is that I’m terrible at proposing *solutions*!That got me thinking. Approaches/models/theories like [OODA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop) and [sense and respond](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_and_respond) involve a number of different skillsets:

* Observation … taking in large amounts of information
* Systems thinking
* Dreaming up ideas to exploit opportunities
* Matching “best practices” to a specific context
* Supporting initiatives (clearing roadblocks and coaching)
* Predicting how competitors will respond
* Linking actions to impacts (we did this, and that happened)
* Seeing the opportunities in a tough situation
* … and many more
Below I take a quick stab at trying to group some of these high level skills as they relate to a simplified feedback loop (sense and respond in this case).

Where in this system do you thrive? Where do you have trouble?

#### Sense the Landscape

**We view the landscape without deconstructing it. **Focus on observation.

#### Sense Boundaries & Relationships

**How do these parts interact? Where are the boundaries? **We understand the landscape as a system of systems.

#### Sense Possibilities

**What might happen here moving forward?** We contemplate possible futures. Is the landscape evolving in a particular direction? Is the landscape subject to certain laws and patterns?

#### Sense Opportunities

**Where are the opportunities and threats?** We sense the opportunities for survival and improved fitness within that evolving landscape.

#### Sense Potential

**[Some intervention] may be beneficial in this situation!** We pair interventions with opportunities in the landscape. To do this, we must be familiar with the intervention AND its suitability within the current landscape

#### Intervene

Intervene to sense/change the landscape. All of the items in this list are interventions. Sensing is an intervention. Intervention is an act of sensemaking.

#### Support Interventions

**[Some intervention] will work better if we do [some other intervention].** Create an environment conducive to an intervention being more successful. This supporting intervention might involve teaching, coaching, or removing external blockers.

#### Sense Impact

**The landscape is changing because we did [some intervention].** The ability to observe the impact of interventions on the landscape.

#### Judge Impact

**[Some intervention] is positive/negative.** Labeling the impacts we see on the landscape as positive or negative in relation to some desired change in the landscape.

#### Modulate Interventions

**Let’s do more of [some intervention] and less of [another intervention].** The decision to amplify/dampen one or more interventions in relation to some desired change in the landscape.

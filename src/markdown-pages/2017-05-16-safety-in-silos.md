![](/images/1*r8FAvV8Iz16s9gg2uXplmQ.png)Insert picture of silos here ….What you if you “rewarded” cross-functional product development teams when they delivered validated outcomes for customers (vs. rewarding them for feature velocity)

?

Oh there are a lot of reasons not to….

* Oh goodness, how can you measure that?
* By the time we can measure that, the team will have moved on to something else!
* Who will be responsible for measuring? Will they game the numbers?
* We do our part… focusing on velocity and quality!
* That’s not the current criteria we use for someone to move up from junior to senior in engineering.
* All of that is validated before we even start coding.
* People in our team report to three different departments. How would that work?
* What if engineering moves too slowly? Who takes responsibility?
* But there’s so much technical debt. We’ve got our hands tied. I’m not sure we can create outcomes. Just shipping is hard.
* It is really about the optics. Our investors are looking at our output!
* We are just trying to add bullet points to the feature list. That is what will make us competitive.
* By the time the work reaches us, it is already pretty prescriptive. We control the technical solution (the “how”), but don’t really have a say in the “what”.
* The outcome is already decided! The customer agreed to buy if we built this. So our only job is to build it quickly.
* The comp structure is already fucked as it is. Do you mean bonuses?
* Oh then we’d take on all kinds of technical debt because the incentives would be out of whack.
* I can see product being measured like this. But why engineers?
When you read these answers, do any themes stand out? And did you assume that by “rewarded” I meant a financial reward vs. what the org celebrates and tells stories about?

The reality is that the biggest force keeping us locked into the [feature factory](https://hackernoon.com/12-signs-youre-working-in-a-feature-factory-44a5b938d6a2) is structure and local optimization. It is hard… not because the tools and practices are particularly hard, but because we structure our organizations around trust proxies, hand-offs, and mini-kingdoms.

Engineering is asked to be “responsive” and to “build it right”. Which then pushes the burden to UX and Product to define the “it” beforehand. Which then incentivizes *them *to stake their incentives on “predictability” and “shipping the roadmap”. “Do your part”… and everything will be OK.

So. When decrying the [feature factory](https://hackernoon.com/12-signs-youre-working-in-a-feature-factory-44a5b938d6a2), make sure you look deeply at how your own department might be structured. What are the incentives? In my experience, the front-liners care about impact and outcomes. But something along the way divides up that sense of responsibility.

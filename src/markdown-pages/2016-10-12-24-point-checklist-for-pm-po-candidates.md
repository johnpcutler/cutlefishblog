For a quick post today I thought I’d share a personal checklist for assessing product management / product owner candidates. These 24 items are useful when 1) thinking about the role you hope to fill, and 2) assessing a candidate. It can take a lifetime of shipping to max out your chops, so it is important to view all of these skills on a continuum.

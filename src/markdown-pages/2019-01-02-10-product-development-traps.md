![](/images/1*QaTue7XbJqpB_vxPpNbmyw.jpeg)These are not “rules”, but rather *tendencies*. We seem wired to go in one direction, and have to actively offset the tendency. I’ve fallen into each of these (repeatedly) over the years, and have observed extremely savvy product developers do the same. How do you avoid them? Two things stand out: 1) visualize the work and limit work in progress, and 2)

 make it safe for team members to call out tensions, lack of coherence, etc.

I’m writing a book that covers these traps and more. [You can check it out here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oNIcstoV0wbEeOBITIG5XP1lbbugaNj7AfoIe0zI7Ss/edit?usp=sharing). I’d love your comments.

1. We **underestimate** the amount of work we actually have in progress and the impact (of that high WIP) on flow, quality, and value delivered…and **overestimate** the value of parallelizing work
2. We **underestimate** the drag created by dependencies, constraints, hand-offs, reviews, etc. … and **overestimate** our ability to navigate them, play Tetris, and thread the needle
3. We **underestimate** the impact of “lights on” and “business as usual” type work…and **overestimate** our ability to tackle these issues without a big hit on flow
4. We **underestimate** what the current team can do with support, trust, safety, and letting go of past grievances… and **overestimate** the value of consultants, “fresh faces”, and process fixes
5. We **underestimate** the difficulty of creating lasting shared understanding and the speed with which understanding degrades…and **overestimate** our ability to “align” with one-off meetings
6. We **underestimate** the value of converging late…and **overestimate** our ability to “sync up” the understanding of small planning groups with “the teams when they start”
7. We **underestimate** the positive impact of high quality on future value flow…and **overestimate** the incremental value of cutting corners and shipping early
8. We **underestimate** the value of diverse perspectives, ideas, pairing, swarming, etc. … and **overestimate** efficiency gains by farming out work to individuals (individual backlogs)
9. We **underestimate** the non-engineering costs associated with new features…and overestimate the degree to which individual features make/break the product (vs. the overall experience)
10. We **underestimate** the potential value in pursuing risky/uncertain opportunities…and **overestimate** the value of “sure things”
Have any to add using this form (underestimate … overestimate) ? Please let me know in the comments.

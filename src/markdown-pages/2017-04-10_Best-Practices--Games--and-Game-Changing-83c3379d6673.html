These exchanges leave me pretty frustrated, and I was wondering why. I also got most of the way through <a href="https://medium.com/u/94a2a063be85" data-href="https://medium.com/u/94a2a063be85" data-anchor-type="2" data-user-id="94a2a063be85" data-action-value="94a2a063be85" data-action="show-user-card" data-action-type="hover" class="markup--user markup--p-user" target="_blank">Jeff Gothelf</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/u/7f786c230ca9" data-href="https://medium.com/u/7f786c230ca9" data-anchor-type="2" data-user-id="7f786c230ca9" data-action-value="7f786c230ca9" data-action="show-user-card" data-action-type="hover" class="markup--user markup--p-user" target="_blank">Josh Seiden</a>’s book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HLN0QGQ/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HLN0QGQ/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sense and Respond</a> which offered up some new angles.</p><p name="6a7e" id="6a7e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here’s the best I can come up with (re: my frustration). These various debates lack context. At any given point, you should keep the following questions in mind about your particular situation:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="ad6b" id="ad6b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">The Game</strong>. What game are we playing? What are the “rules” (self-imposed, external, etc.) ?</li><li name="6bc0" id="6bc0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Disruption</strong>. How can we change the nature/rules of the game?</li><li name="d626" id="d626" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Evolution</strong>. How will the game change without our intervention(s)?</li><li name="3847" id="3847" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Best Practices</strong>. How do the best players play the game?</li><li name="0171" id="0171" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Training</strong>. How can we become better game players? How can we can eventually outperform the best players?</li></ol><p name="7790" id="7790" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">These questions are obviously related. For example, one might use best practices (#4) to identify the game (#1), and train people to become better at it (#5). Or even use best practices to shift games (#2), and render other best practices less effective. Or the iPhone might get released (#3) triggering a shift in how we think about the game (#1). Etc.</p><p name="2d57" id="2d57" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">People use expertise, tools, and methodologies to help:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="9d0b" id="9d0b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Understand</strong>. Answer these questions</li><li name="c774" id="c774" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Act</strong>. act/execute based on our answers to these questions</li><li name="9e47" id="9e47" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Reflect</strong>. reflect on/reassess our answers to these questions</li><li name="8741" id="8741" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Improve</strong>. Get better at answering, executing, and reflecting</li></ul><p name="974b" id="974b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">And this gets super meta … you can think of these points as games.</p><p name="a47c" id="a47c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Some things that seem to hold true:</strong></p><ul class="postList"><li name="871a" id="871a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Some games change very slowly. Most dominant actors play the game in a similar way<strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">. </strong>Other games are in a state of flux. The rules are loose. Approaches to playing the game vary widely. There are only so many ways you can fulfill government contracts for missile guidance systems (for example)</li><li name="bb3a" id="bb3a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">You can be playing many games at once (e.g. broad games like “software development” or “design”, and narrower games like “cloud analytics providers” or “consumer fitness wearables”)</li><li name="3100" id="3100" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Innovation often involves changing games that were previously considered unchangeable, acting on knowledge of a changing game, or pretending to play one game, while really playing a different game</li><li name="0f12" id="0f12" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Sometimes you win by consistently playing a known game perfectly. Sometimes your key strength is rule changing and game identification. Sometimes you win by learning new games quickly</li><li name="59a4" id="59a4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Best practices in a highly constrained game may not be applicable to a less constrained version of the game. Practices can be “first principles” — applicable to a whole class of games — or offer more specific guidance for a narrower game</li><li name="54ee" id="54ee" class="graf graf--li graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--li">“Transformation” involves understanding the current game, possibly changing the game, predicting external changes to the game, understanding what skills remain applicable in the new game, and adopting new skills where applicable. Transformation is <em class="markup--em markup--li-em">not </em>about playing the existing game better (which can be very important, as well)</li></ul><p name="9d26" id="9d26" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What to watch out for…</strong></p><ul class="postList"><li name="ad57" id="ad57" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">When you find yourself saying “it can’t work here” … what are you basing that on? Is the game truly different? Are you referring to internal rules or external rules? What are the “best” people doing who play your game?</li><li name="cac6" id="cac6" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Debating tools and practices without discussing these questions (1–5) is a waste of time</li><li name="14d5" id="14d5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">High level manifestos and principles are helpful, but it is important not to conflate these with the practice/tools they inspire (e.g. Agile and Scrum). The problems that Scrum solves may not be applicable for the game you are playing</li><li name="2814" id="2814" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Scrum is cited as something for beginners. Yet it doesn’t resemble what more advanced teams are doing. Is that smart? This relates heavily to how the best people are playing the game (#4) and the best way to get them there (#5). If you take a step back, you might be in the business of software product development. Scrum is a small part of that game.</li><li name="c3b9" id="c3b9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">We frequently cite compliance and the “existing culture” as a blocker. Why do we start first with the front-line teams (#5) and the generic game of software development (#1) ? It would seem that the first step would be to start playing a different game (#2). But that’s hard because it is a lot harder to get executives to do something different (#5). Devs are easy in comparison</li><li name="fa91" id="fa91" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Depending on who you ask about NoEstimates, you’ll discover that someone is trying to solve dysfunction and shift the game (#2), the next person feels they have a better way to play a particular game (#4), and most people aren’t clear about the game in question (#1). That’s confusing</li></ul><p name="21bc" id="21bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li graf--trailing">There’s nothing groundbreaking (or original) about these questions. I’m sure game theorists would eat my for lunch. My point is that people should 1) question their own assumptions, and 2) try to build shared understanding. Most of the “debates” I participate in are lacking any sort of shared context. Let’s fix that.</p></div></div></section>

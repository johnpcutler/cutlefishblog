Busy with the newborn, but still pondering, [tweeting](https://mobile.twitter.com/johncutlefish), writing some [thinky posts](https://hackernoon.com/beyond-outcomes-over-outputs-6b2677044214) (influenced by the lack of sleep, no doubt), and occasionally doing [short, low fidelity podcasts](https://anchor.fm/john-cutler/)).

Last night’s sleepy list…when is process “good” ?

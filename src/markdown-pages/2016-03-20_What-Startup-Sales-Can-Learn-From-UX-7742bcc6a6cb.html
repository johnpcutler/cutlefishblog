We blame ourselves for misunderstanding our own needs and motivations, the product for not “working”, the salesperson for coercing us, and the flashy (but misleading) ad. For whatever reason, things don’t work out. Boxsets go unwatched, bikes go unridden, <a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cars/survey-shows-many-high-tech-car-features-go-unused" data-href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cars/survey-shows-many-high-tech-car-features-go-unused" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">high-tech car features go untouched</a>, and personal finance software gathers virtual dust.</p><p name="3cb3" id="3cb3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This extends to much of the software we <a href="http://swreflections.blogspot.com/2013/11/applying-8020-rule-in-software.html" data-href="http://swreflections.blogspot.com/2013/11/applying-8020-rule-in-software.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">use in our day-to-day work</a>.</p><p name="210a" id="210a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For some hot domains in the B2B SaaS software world — collaboration, analytics, big-data, CRM, and marketing automation — the root problem is not a tool problem. Tools, and countless variations, exist by the boatload. Rather, the problem exists in our organizational cultures, structures, and roles, our data-literacy, our ability to adapt to new ways of working, and our <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">innate individuality</em> when it comes to interacting with products in general. It’s tough to be one-size-fits-all.</p><p name="e7f5" id="e7f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These are meaty problems that transcend domain. They <a href="https://index.co/top/market/saas/investments/2016" data-href="https://index.co/top/market/saas/investments/2016" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">attract a lot of entrepreneurial and investment attention</a>, despite the competitive landscape and low odds of success. Even when you understand those root barriers to adoption (culture, skills, literacy), forging a repeatable business model can be challenging. But most don’t get that far …</p><p name="ca64" id="ca64" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Beyond dealing with the competition, startups routinely drift into confusion and cognitive bias. Founders confuse their own early sales efforts — selling on vision and big picture — <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2010/10/12/startup-sales-why-hiring-seasoned-reps-may-not-work/" data-href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2010/10/12/startup-sales-why-hiring-seasoned-reps-may-not-work/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">with the day-to-day work of their reps</a>. We equate growth with demand and a large available market. And assume our product “fits” because someone presses Purchase Now or cuts a check.</p><p name="b80a" id="b80a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Popular methodologies (e.g. Lean Startup) promote experimentation. But there’s a big difference between testing with a squirt gun and a firehose. Lean Startup stresses <a href="http://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_promise_of_lean_experimentation" data-href="http://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_promise_of_lean_experimentation" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">structured and focused experiments</a>, but this rigor is often overlooked when the rubber hits the road and the team fires up <a href="https://www.marketo.com/" data-href="https://www.marketo.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Marketo</a> and <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/" data-href="http://www.salesforce.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Salesforce</a>.</p><p name="faf6" id="faf6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Testing with a firehose can yield results (think growth and sales) but not the learnings required to sustain that growth before running out of money or imploding. This extends to being “customer-obsessed”.</p><p name="682a" id="682a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We confuse our ability to sell to and support our customers with our ability to repeatedly make someone happy with our product. Heroic efforts feel great, but it is <a href="https://hbr.org/2012/02/the-end-of-customer-service-he" data-href="https://hbr.org/2012/02/the-end-of-customer-service-he" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">damn difficult to make them repeatedly great</a>. It translates to customer education — “our customers would absolutely fall in love with our product if they knew how to use it”. And most nefariously to how we iterate on and build our product — “if our customers pay us, then their requests are valuable”.</p><p name="b021" id="b021" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The common theme here is a misunderstanding (either through lack of experience, or founder goggles) of something user experience professionals deal with every day. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3013474/" data-href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3013474/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">No one person or company thinks, works, and adopts software the same way</a>. Personas are far more rich and varied than we would like to believe. Product complexity increases exponentially as the number of personas/goals/situations increase. To solve someone’s problem, and validate that you’ve solved it, you need to get <a href="http://www.instigatorblog.com/good-hypotheses/2011/05/05/" data-href="http://www.instigatorblog.com/good-hypotheses/2011/05/05/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">specific</a>.</p><p name="43a2" id="43a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is something that most of us understand intuitively — “no one person is the same” — but its impact on product design and sales service design (sales is a “service” if you think about it) is routinely underestimated. It’s the opportunist in all of us. We’d like to believe that there is a homogenous groundswell of interest in our product. So we turn on the sales firehose.</p><figure name="480f" id="480f" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 650px; max-height: 475px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 73.1%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*sie8DhRoJZulViTzUsXmBA.png" data-width="650" data-height="475" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*sie8DhRoJZulViTzUsXmBA.png"></div></figure><p name="3729" id="3729" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Sales and UX have a lot in common. Both deal with psychology every day — sales to <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/daniel-pink-to-sell-is-human-2013-1" data-href="http://www.businessinsider.com/daniel-pink-to-sell-is-human-2013-1" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">close the deal</a>, and <a href="https://uxmag.com/articles/the-psychologists-view-of-ux-design" data-href="https://uxmag.com/articles/the-psychologists-view-of-ux-design" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">UX to design the experience</a>. Sales understands that certain pains are ubiquitous, and routinely exploits that to close a deal and connect that to the story of your product. It’s necessary to try novel things and be scrappy. New stories, incentives, and nudges move the needle in the short-term. What we say we need, and what we actually need are two different things. Sales and UX gets all of this.</p><p name="c0cb" id="c0cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Like users, sales teams optimize around what is “easiest” to sell, which may not correlate with what is easiest to support, retain, and grow. Internally, incentives reign supreme and — as any UX pro knows — it is difficult to reroute the sales freight train once it is up to full speed. Once a sales team gets moving it takes on a life of its own. Without <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/12/dont-turn-your-sales-team-loose-without-a-strategy" data-href="https://hbr.org/2015/12/dont-turn-your-sales-team-loose-without-a-strategy" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a strategy</a>, things can go a little haywire. Part and parcel to that strategy is having a sense of the “who”.</p><figure name="3b06" id="3b06" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 700px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 100%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*juOfh1pFqOVmICjLKHxkWg.png" data-width="800" data-height="800" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*juOfh1pFqOVmICjLKHxkWg.png"></div></figure><p name="f5ae" id="f5ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">UX knows it is very difficult to design a product or service that pleases all people, in all situations. People may look similar, and their pains may, in fact, be similar, but their product needs are not similar. Sales sells to common pains. UX designs for specific groupings of people and their pains. When UX thinks about personas they consider (among other things) technical savvy, experience with similar tools, experience in the domain, psychographics, barriers to adoption, relationships, demographics, behavioral traits, and organizational culture. Importantly, they design for a limited “fingerprint” across these various <a href="http://www.servicedesigntoolkit.org/assets2013/posters/EN/P3-persona%20dimensions-A1.pdf" data-href="http://www.servicedesigntoolkit.org/assets2013/posters/EN/P3-persona%20dimensions-A1.pdf" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dimensions</a>.</p><figure name="634d" id="634d" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 610px; max-height: 432px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 70.8%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*7Cv8zQGubobRAua4cpdxEQ.png" data-width="610" data-height="432" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*7Cv8zQGubobRAua4cpdxEQ.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption"><a href="http://www.elezea.com/2013/09/case-study-vumi-go-redesign/" data-href="http://www.elezea.com/2013/09/case-study-vumi-go-redesign/" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">http://www.elezea.com/2013/09/case-study-vumi-go-redesign/</a></figcaption></figure><p name="40ed" id="40ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">For example, there is a big difference between someone who knows how to solve the problem (with the right tool) and someone who aspirationally seeks a solution. Both will buy the product and respond to pain selling. Building a product for both requires different strategies. John, an executive in a low growth industry working inside a stiff organizational culture will behave differently from Mary, an exec working inside a nimble, tech-forward organization in a high-growth sector. Both may be aware of the problem to solve. They agree on that. But John’s work will need to withstand organizational blockers, while Mary has to be scrappy and get the data she needs to secure next year’s budget.</p><figure name="92c8" id="92c8" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 526px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 75.1%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*jYvKGLHWArEF46xdeajYrQ.png" data-width="767" data-height="576" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jYvKGLHWArEF46xdeajYrQ.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption"><a href="http://www.bryaneisenberg.com/personas-magic-behind-mirror/" data-href="http://www.bryaneisenberg.com/personas-magic-behind-mirror/" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">http://www.bryaneisenberg.com/personas-magic-behind-mirror/</a></figcaption></figure><p name="0d15" id="0d15" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Increasing sales does not mean you have a <a href="https://salesandmarketing.com/content/sales-playbooks-key-repeatable-sales-process" data-href="https://salesandmarketing.com/content/sales-playbooks-key-repeatable-sales-process" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">repeatable sales process</a>, or a repeatable path to growth. It doesn’t prove your product actually delivers specific value. Proving this requires more rigor. You are validating a “designed” sales process:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="e3b9" id="e3b9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">A specific user persona, buyer personas, and organizational persona</li><li name="750f" id="750f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Your ability to locate, attract, and communicate with all three in a repeatable fashion</li><li name="289d" id="289d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Understand the <a href="https://articles.uie.com/multiple_personalities/" data-href="https://articles.uie.com/multiple_personalities/" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">varied needs of a specific set of users</a></li><li name="473b" id="473b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><a href="http://startupmanagement.org/2014/10/14/messaging-positioning-branding-for-startups-what-happens-after-productmarket-fit/" data-href="http://startupmanagement.org/2014/10/14/messaging-positioning-branding-for-startups-what-happens-after-productmarket-fit/" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Structured and consistent messaging and marketing </a>… a singular brand message</li><li name="78f4" id="78f4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Similar touch points along the customer journey</li><li name="d6bd" id="d6bd" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">A match with the product as it exists today.

A startup can rapidly meet new customer requests. Will the customer be as enthusiastic as that growth slows?</li></ul><p name="ad6b" id="ad6b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">The key here is specificity. Selling to everyone may make your quota, but it diminishes learning.</p><p name="bac4" id="bac4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">UX deals with this often. When we research and design, we focus on specific personas (or small set of personas). When we test our designs, we focus on people AND situations that match those personas. We iterate on that understanding constantly. And then we apply those learnings and patterns elsewhere in the product. Through a variety of methods, UX Research seeks to answer three questions — <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/tsharon/validating-assumptions-with-12-ux-research-methods" data-href="https://speakerdeck.com/tsharon/validating-assumptions-with-12-ux-research-methods" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">what do people want, what do people need, and can people use it</a> — — through the lense of a specific person and situation</p><p name="9d6f" id="9d6f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What are some specific examples?</p><p name="c34f" id="c34f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Nothing new here, but UX (and marketing) develops AND validates <a href="https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/persona-s-non-grata-5587cb46409c" data-href="https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/persona-s-non-grata-5587cb46409c" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">rich personas</a>. Are these people who we think they are? Does their behavior match who we think they are? We consider <a href="http://www.contentharmony.com/blog/bootstrapped-customer-persona-validation/" data-href="http://www.contentharmony.com/blog/bootstrapped-customer-persona-validation/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">psychographics, demographics, goals, motivations, roadblocks, domain-specific characteristics, current roadblocks</a>, etc. This is commonplace for big companies, but during the startup phase we are constantly drilling down, iterating, and validating our “persona hypothesis”. This is almost impossible if you’re taking a broad approach. Sure, your sales and growth might be higher, but you’re not learning.</p><figure name="d0d4" id="d0d4" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 240px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 34.300000000000004%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*yEolUvVRg8rQiKokLUQq5Q.png" data-width="1024" data-height="351" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*yEolUvVRg8rQiKokLUQq5Q.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption"><a href="http://www.garymagnone.com/blog/content-marketing-digital-touchpoints/" data-href="http://www.garymagnone.com/blog/content-marketing-digital-touchpoints/" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">http://www.garymagnone.com/blog/content-marketing-digital-touchpoints/</a></figcaption></figure><p name="6cee" id="6cee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">This attention extends to the customer journey. How does the customer interact with your company from first impressions — the ad online or mention at a conference — to their first renewal as a happy company. UXers attempt to understand these types of problems using <a href="http://www.servicedesigntools.org/tools/8" data-href="http://www.servicedesigntools.org/tools/8" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">customer journey maps</a> and then by validating these against actual customer behavior. Again, the more of these you now support, the more assumptions you have in “inventory”. Sheer luck and persistence can grow the business, but learning which journey actually produces that happy renewal is paramount.</p><p name="f576" id="f576" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Finally, UX is constantly testing prototypes. We design low-cost experiments (designs), test, and iterate. Before doubling down, we make sure the design is going to work. This extends to pushing product live and measuring how people actually use the product. Modern startup buzz-wordists have coined the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hacking" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hacking" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">growth hacker,</a> and on many levels UX and growth-hacking are remarkably similar: with common traits of creativity, experimentation, prototyping, empathy, data and analysis.</p><p name="628d" id="628d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m persuaded that the real value of freemium and self-serve free-trial models is that they create a framework within which it is difficult to bias the results. The models limit touch points and user journeys. We validate our positioning, adoption, and renewal in a repeatable way that can be easily adapted. Perhaps that’s the true value … freemium and self-service free trials may not be “better” than more high touch sales, but they certainly have the potential to be a lot less biased.</p><p name="9063" id="9063" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In closing …</p><ul class="postList"><li name="278f" id="278f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">View sales as a <a href="http://www.servicedesigntools.org/" data-href="http://www.servicedesigntools.org/" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">service design concep</a>t, and embrace those methods accordingly. On principle, you’ll start with specific personas which is the real message here. You’ll learn to understand the customer journey across your product — from first touch to renewal.</li><li name="1517" id="1517" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Choose learning over growth. <a href="http://steveblank.com/2015/05/06/build-measure-learn-throw-things-against-the-wall-and-see-if-they-work/" data-href="http://steveblank.com/2015/05/06/build-measure-learn-throw-things-against-the-wall-and-see-if-they-work/" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Learning starts with specific tests, not a firehose</a>. Learning transcends departments in your growing startup. Set learning goals, not sales goals. The sales model validation process cannot be run independently of product or retention experiments.</li><li name="fa0c" id="fa0c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Embrace the value of the <a href="https://leanstack.com/lean-canvas/" data-href="https://leanstack.com/lean-canvas/" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lean canvas</a> in all of its complexity. Don’t skimp on the market segmentation, cost model, and channel hypotheses. Testing more than one or two things at once is virtually impossible.</li><li name="2df8" id="2df8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li graf--trailing">Attract a sales team that is open to iterating, learning, and rolling with changes in approach. Your best bet may be less experienced, but more flexible team members.</li></ul></div></div></section>

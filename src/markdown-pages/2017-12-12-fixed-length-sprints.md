Some quick thoughts on fixed-length iterations.

Sure, fixed cadences may help with some things. But not everything needs to move on the same cadence, or on a cadence at all. Some things are best “pulled” instead of “pushed”.

**You don’t NEED fixed-length iterations (“sprints”) to:**

* Hold a retrospective on some cadence
* Have daily, weekly, monthly goals
* Share your work with customers when you need to
* Have demos when you need to (or on some cadence)
* Improve how you decompose work
* Learn how to “work small”
* Constrain the size of stories
* Think in terms of releasable increments
* Have daily standups
* Celebrate wins
* Review customer data to make decisions
* Trigger the decomposition of work on a cadence or when needed
* “Ship” valuable work to customer on some cadence
* Meet to update your working agreements
* Report progress towards a goal
* Change course/pivot at the optimal time
* Run continuous improvement experiments
If you’re doing “one week sprints”, what does that mean for releasable increments that take 4 days, or 9 days? Or 1 day? Anyway. Something to consider. By all means do what works and apply health constraints / forcing functions.

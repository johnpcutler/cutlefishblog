Is Agile **dead**? Is it **outdated**? Does it **suck**?

You tell me … how many of your work interactions are:

* Humane
* Curious
* Observant
* Creative
* Diverse
* Effective
* Adaptable
* Emotionally Honest
* Intellectually Honest
* Safe
* Hopeful
* Sustainable
* Respectful
* Reflective ?
Maybe for fleeting moment? Maybe for a year during the “good times”? Maybe when you “had a great team once, on that project”?

Exactly. We can always do *better*. If scrum isn’t your thing, then find something *better*.

Agile is a reminder that there’s always room for more empathy, happiness, and impact in our work and personal lives. Beyond the infographics, methods, acronyms, debates, books, white-papers, and rants, exists a simple set of guidelines to [collaborate, deliver, reflect, and improve by](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Rediscovering+the+Heart+of+Agile).

This is why I’m so happy to be attending (and speaking at) Alistair Cockburn’s [Heart of Agile conference in Philly](http://heartofagile.com/heart-of-agile-philadelphia/). Because it’s good to give yourself (and your teams) permission to be hopeful and curious.

See you there!

It makes so much possible, and is so difficult to regain when things go south. When there’s trust (and safety), we are able to invite all sorts of more challenging interactions into the equation. Consider the message we send to a team when we impose a process meant to “root out” some sort of bad behavior or slacking. It conveys: “I don’t trust you”. Trust and safety are internally-generated intangible assets, so they don’t get recorded on the balance sheet…which both makes absolute sense, and is crazy at the same time.</li><li name="85b0" id="85b0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">We among the individual contributor set tend to demonize words like accountability, commitment, predictability, ownership, and responsibility</strong>…mostly because we perceive them to run in a single direction (top — &gt; down). Most of us have also seen these words repeatedly abused over the years (typically in conjunction with estimates, goals, etc.)…so much so that they lose any positive connotation. But can systems thrive without a <em class="markup--em markup--li-em">commitment</em> to trust and safety, to teamwork, and to respect? Prepend the word “mutual” before accountability and commitment…how does that change our perspective? Are we too jaded to imagine mutually beneficial, mutually committed, and mutual accountable work situations?</li><li name="2932" id="2932" class="graf graf--li graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">“The work” is often treated as the primary currency of accountability and commitment.</strong> Why? It is relatively tangible. Focusing on “the work” also reinforces the desire for autonomy in terms of how to finish the work (“you tell us the what, we decide the how”). But… “the work” is only one part of the puzzle. Who is responsible for the health of the system surrounding “the work”? Management? Leaders? Or everyone? If work is the first-class accountability object, what does that say about how the org prioritizes the “other stuff” (like safety, support, growth)?</li><li name="4850" id="4850" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Along those lines, how to we handle the case where so much variability and unpredictability surrounds “the work”?</strong> And what happens when people are incentivized to deliver exactly what they promised to deliver…even if it is the wrong thing to deliver? Is under-promise / over-deliver what we actually want? Maybe variability is our constant, and “doing your best” is all we can do given the context.</li><li name="19c1" id="19c1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Can managers serve multiple masters?</strong> One view of management is that it is in “support” of their teams (coach, facilitator, mentor). Another view is that managers are there to literally extract the “right work” out of teams. How is “accountability” and “responsibility” viewed in both models?</li><li name="5dd0" id="5dd0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Some cultures are considered “difficult” but they are also highly predictable.</strong> Employees know what they are getting into. Expectations are extremely high, but are “predictably high” and explicit. Employees often describe good managers as being “very tough, but fair”. There’s strife between departments, but people know “what to expect”. What’s going on here? Is it really coherence we crave when we voluntarily agree to take a particular job?</li><li name="5170" id="5170" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">No one likes being held “accountable” for something they cannot fully control.</strong> It causes all sorts of cognitive dissonance, hedging, and fear. This is one of the big blockers when it comes to having a team commit to an outcome (over individual “commitments”).</li><li name="e5b7" id="e5b7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">There are <em class="markup--em markup--li-em">always problems…</em>especially in rapid changing landscapes<em class="markup--em markup--li-em">.</em> </strong>Meaning that it is always possible to point at something and say “that is fucked up”. That said, there are varying levels of fuck-upped-ness, and different people have different needs for coherence, trust, and support. When I talk to people who have stuck around in their current companies for &gt;5 years, I tend to hear that there are indeed problems, but that in general most things work themselves out.</li><li name="c010" id="c010" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">What do we do when “root cause” lands at the human condition?</strong></li><li name="232c" id="232c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Process frequently serves as a trust and safety proxy</strong>, while simultaneously introducing drag, and amplifying mistrust and toxicity. On the flip side, some process serves as a “contract” from which to build trust from a place a distrust. Take a look at a framework like Scrum. Consider the fears, aspirations, and worldview baked into its design. Consider whether it embodies a chip on the shoulder…developers who feel untrusted and constantly blamed. When Scrum reveals “the problem”, what dictates whether the positive or negative path emerges?</li><li name="3843" id="3843" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">We have incredibly sensitive coherence radars when it comes to external things</strong> (the company being fucked up, and behavior inconsistent).

What is that costing you?”</p><p name="c98b" id="c98b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">C:</strong> “Well…we’re losing market share. Our customers are anxious for improvements. And the stuff we do release just isn’t having enough impact. I’m sure you can understand the pressure I’m under!? The last couple board meetings have been pretty tense.”</p><p name="7279" id="7279" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">OP: </strong>“I’m sure. Must be tough. This all sounds like it could be costing you a considerable amount of money. Do you…”</p><p name="3ba9" id="3ba9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">C: </strong>“And it’s getting worse! Or at least it <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">feels</em> like it is getting worse. Every quarter it is the same old story. We started to bring the consultants in last quarter to help out. Some of them are OK…but who knows? They talk the talk…that’s for sure.”</p><p name="d3b3" id="d3b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">OP: </strong>“Are you learning anything from them?”</p><p name="0f00" id="0f00" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">C: </strong>“I’m learning how to pay their invoices! Hah! But honestly, in most cases they are repeating things that people have said internally —especially during exit interviews. Of course the consultants are a lot more polished, and have better PowerPoint presentations. Plus, there is a never-ending buffet of the services they’re willing to sell us. But who knows?”</p><p name="2485" id="2485" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">OP: </strong>“Do they?”</p><p name="cb95" id="cb95" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">C: </strong>“It’s almost like everyone has read the same ten books or something! You know…single-word title, airport book bullshit: Spark, Magic, Disrupt. Then they tell me what Amazon, Netflix, Spotify, and Google are doing. We’re not Google by the way…we don’t print money.”</p><p name="d6ed" id="d6ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">OP: </strong>“Very few companies are unique.

What are they saying?”</p><p name="172c" id="172c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">C: </strong>“It is like a formula. First, they need money and headcount. Second, it isn’t their fault. Third, they try to pitch something. Fourth, they kiss my ass while simultaneously telling me how hard it is to meet their departmental goals. I should have them fill out a form before they meet me.”</p><p name="fb4c" id="fb4c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">OP: </strong>“Backing up…how much would you pay to make a big dent in these problems, and turn things around?”</p><p name="da7d" id="da7d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">C: </strong>“That is a very theoretical question. I mean for fuck’s sake, this is what I’m paying my leaders and managers to do right now! I’m already paying for this! I pay people to keep this under control. And now they turn around and tell me it is all messed up. Why didn’t they bring up these issues earlier? Who was on watch?”</p><p name="38f9" id="38f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">OP: </strong>“With all due respect… you were on watch. Right?

But I wasn’t getting actionable information! No solutions! Imagine having six people basically complaining and pitching to you non-stop. And let’s face it, none of them are going to admit their side of the house is in disarray. Plus I admit that saying No to me can be pretty tough. With all that static, how do you know where to double-down?”</p><p name="08b0" id="08b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">OP: </strong>“That must be hard.

Do you know how lonely this job can be sometime?”</p><p name="f966" id="f966" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">OP: </strong>“Pretty lonely, I imagine. And not a lot of time to see your family. I’m sorry.”</p><p name="a393" id="a393" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">C: </strong>“Continue…”</p><p name="2b74" id="2b74" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">OP: </strong>“OK. Let’s just accept that you’re in a tough spot. Getting out of a tough spot takes work. There are no silver bullets. Something is going to need to change. What if I told you that you could cut the lead times for your most valuable work by 80%. Would you pay for that?”</p><p name="4117" id="4117" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">C: </strong>“Well sure…<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">in theory!</em> We would spend tons of money for that. Send me the bill. But you just told me there are no silver bullets!”</p><p name="365e" id="365e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">OP: </strong>“Alas, this isn’t a silver bullet. The payment would be: removing a whole layer of middle-management, combining two departments, bringing the outsourcing in-house, attempting 50–70% fewer projects, focusing on a small number of high-value efforts, leaving many teams idle for the time-being if they can’t swarm on the bottleneck, hiring some key expertise, addressing the retention issue, investing in dedicated tooling and infrastructure support for teams, hiring full-time coaches for front-line teams and managers/leaders, doing a major refactor of the core product, and missing your revenue goals for the next 2 or 3 quarters.”</p><p name="a0a8" id="a0a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">C: </strong>“You’re fucking with me. Do you think I’m an idiot? Do you think I can just march into the board meeting and lay that giant stinking turd on the table? I’d get fired.”</p><p name="fc65" id="fc65" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">OP: </strong>“You’re not an idiot… this isn’t easy. I know how hard that would be…”</p><p name="5b39" id="5b39" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">C: </strong>“Plus we have consultants here in-house teaching our teams to be more `Agile`. You know…the standups and sprints and all that. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Twice the Work In Half The Time</em>! I’m pretty sure that is the book I saw on that managers’s desk. Sounds like this was a waste of time. It obviously didn’t <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">scale</em>, which probably explains why the consultants are pitching this SAFER thing. Hey, I don’t care what they do as long as I get my red/orange/green dashboard and they hit their deadlines.”</p><p name="579d" id="579d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">OP: </strong>“That stuff is fine, but there is only so much you can do on the team level, or even just on the engineering department level. It starts with the pressure to ship new stuff. It starts with when you incentivize output over the overall health of the system. The signs were there, but somehow they never reached you. Which suggest an even more important need…the need for psychological safety and openness. Those feedback loops need to be tightened. You’ll need to claw your way out of the hole. Or…”</p><p name="ceea" id="ceea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">C: </strong>“Or what? I’m all ears. We both know that most turnarounds happen <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">after</em> someone like me gets fired.”</p><p name="2840" id="2840" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">OP: </strong>“You can just keep the ship rolling. Shake up the org-chart a bit. Keep things up and to the right. Maybe buy some companies to help with growth.”</p><p name="abba" id="abba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">C: </strong>“You are so cynical. Those aren’t terrible ideas. Companies buy revenue and talent all the time. We’ve got the cash. And no steaming turd for the board.”</p><p name="68d9" id="68d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">OP: </strong>“So it sounds like it is too late?”</p><p name="e119" id="e119" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">C: </strong>“Honestly, I’ve lost trust that we can actually execute.

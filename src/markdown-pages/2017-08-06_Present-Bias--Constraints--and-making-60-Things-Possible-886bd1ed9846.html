The money is right in your face. You can feel it. If you build X, you will make $Y. It’s easy to lose sight of the actual costs (including the opportunity cost).What if you focused on something riskier, but more valuable? We tend to lose sight of that option, which makes sense because thinking too far (or deeply) into the future can have a paralyzing effect. The lion will eat you if it takes that long.</p><p name="20a8" id="20a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Other examples relate to <a href="https://hackernoon.com/40-ways-to-invest-in-more-resilient-teams-c2ac7d008591" data-href="https://hackernoon.com/40-ways-to-invest-in-more-resilient-teams-c2ac7d008591" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">organizational resiliency</a>. It can be tempting to shoot for short-term gains (adding headcount quickly, adding layers of hierarchy, siloing specializations for efficiency), without considering the long term effects. In short…we add constraints and new objectives. Which makes navigating the problem space more difficult. And entropy ensues.</p><figure name="9a88" id="9a88" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 435px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 62.1%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*uxVJLuLuZKiKIKHmxmNXhg.png" data-width="1200" data-height="745" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*uxVJLuLuZKiKIKHmxmNXhg.png"></div></figure><p name="9a4b" id="9a4b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I often run into orgs that are trying <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">so damn hard </em>(as hard as they can, actually), but they can’t seem to generate any forward momentum. They’re layering more and more process on the situation without any impact. They’re chasing down a new symptom every quarter. But when you actually interview the various actors, you learn how insanely constrained their world is. We’re not talking about an inability to find a globally optimal solution. That would be too ambitious. Rather, even mediocre ways forward are impossible, or require mind-numbing 3 dimensional chess.</p><p name="e7a1" id="e7a1" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Installing” Agile without removing constraints will fail.</p><p name="a811" id="a811" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Which brings me to a conversation I had with <a href="https://medium.com/u/7f786c230ca9" data-href="https://medium.com/u/7f786c230ca9" data-anchor-type="2" data-user-id="7f786c230ca9" data-action-value="7f786c230ca9" data-action="show-user-card" data-action-type="hover" class="markup--user markup--p-user" target="_blank">Josh Seiden</a> (Sense &amp; Respond, LeanUX) the other day.

If a Dev or UX sent this to an executive, they’d get an “um”. His challenge — which will take me a while to execute on — was to figure out how to elicit a “hmmm, I think I see what you mean, I get it now, we should act on this!”</p><p name="3552" id="3552" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But how?</p><p name="ff33" id="ff33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When you boil down many of the points in the 42 Things post, you end up at the tension between short(er) and long(er) term thinking, and individual and group intrinsic/extrinsic reward systems. Front-Liners, for example:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="e373" id="e373" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">DO touch the product, the code, and the design</li><li name="438c" id="438c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">DON’T touch the sales quotas, revenue projections, and meetings with investors, lawyers, and analysts</li><li name="eff2" id="eff2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">DO bang their heads against tech-debt ridden code, feel the hit of multi-tasking, and cringe at “just shipping” crappy features</li><li name="645b" id="645b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">DON’T spend 60hrs per week in meetings where people are primarily 1) complaining and/or 2) pitching their pet projects</li><li name="d3f2" id="d3f2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">DO have to sit in close quarters with a small development team, and — according to the data — have to solve a cost/benefit design decision every 15 minutes with very intense cognitively challenging work</li><li name="3337" id="3337" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">DON’T have the fate and livelihood of many hundred (or thousand) people in their hands.

If you’re even luckier, they are able to stand head to head with the CRO, CFO, and CEO, and translate the calculus into an actionable risk-management and continuous improvement framework. They’ll explain why chasing efficiency begets rigidness, and that you need to care about resiliency. They’ll explain why a lack of focus begets an exponential increase in the number of constraints. Finally, they’ll explain why having a tall org might not benefit the product. But that’s if you (and they) are lucky.</p><p name="04f6" id="04f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Consider, then, that senior leaders <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">often</em> don’t understand how certain decisions will impact the future. They’re already too far away from the action and no one has explained the calculus. People are running around talking about UX, Agile, DevOps, leaving slack in the day, lowering utilization, and Outcomes over Output…and someone without experience in the trenches (or experience a long time ago) will not know WTF is going on.</p><blockquote name="771b" id="771b" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">We put humans on the moon.

At one point, you probably had a choice. And that is the central challenge. We need to explain why these choices matter for the long term success of your product development org.

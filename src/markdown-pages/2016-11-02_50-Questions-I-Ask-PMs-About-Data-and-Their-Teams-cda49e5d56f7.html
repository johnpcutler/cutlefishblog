People are looking for the silver bullet:</p><blockquote name="ef6e" id="ef6e" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">I’m also wondering if you’ve seen any good solutions to the product KPI problem in general</blockquote><p name="c3d3" id="c3d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">My response is a typical, befuddled “it depends”. Why does it depend? I’ve yet to find a one-size-fits-all solution. Goals vary. Products vary. Cultures vary. Skills vary. The scope for possible actions vary. At at the end of the day, cultivating a learning culture (a prerequisite in my mind for the responsible use of data) isn’t something you install. That’s the blocker … not some tool, technique, or having access to a data scientist.</p><p name="c421" id="c421" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here is my backup list of questions I use when doing interviews and gathering “data” on an organization before making any recommendations.</p><p name="8fc7" id="8fc7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Use ’em if they’re helpful. Look before you leap, and gauge the organization’s DNA. Then start the experimentation…</p><ol class="postList"><li name="1c7e" id="1c7e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">How open is your culture to disconfirming information? Is it welcomed or fought? What would be the path from that disconfirming insight to an actual change in direction?</li><li name="ac27" id="ac27" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Trying new ways of using evidence and data to drive decisions can be risky. Mistakes are common. How safe is your environment for teams that might make the occasional mistake in their quest to make better decisions?</li><li name="59d0" id="59d0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">When it comes to using evidence to drive better product decisions, what’s working?

What would you ask a crystal ball?</li><li name="356a" id="356a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Could you describe a recent ad-hoc report or analysis you generated?

What is the opposite of being data-driven? Can an organization be customer-driven AND data-driven?</li><li name="ea2a" id="ea2a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">If your teams could get faster feedback, what might that let them do? What type of feedback would drive these actions?</li><li name="4c1d" id="4c1d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Who is involved in your business intelligence efforts? Who do they report to? Who thinks about the big picture and handles cross-functional / cross departmental needs?</li><li name="7c5e" id="7c5e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Words like data, business intelligence, data science, analytics, insights, experimentation, and learning are thrown around often. Can you describe your personal mental model?</li><li name="675b" id="675b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">How do your teams handle and explore ambiguity?</li><li name="e2dc" id="e2dc" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Can you describe insights that exist elsewhere in your organization that are logistically difficult to incorporate/integrate with your product data?

Can you describe some recent struggles with getting data into a state suitable for analysis?</li><li name="28fc" id="28fc" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">How is decision making distributed across your organization? When the Why for a particular decision involves data and evidence, how is that communicated?</li><li name="6d3d" id="6d3d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">An engineer once asked me if there were “passing tests” for product managers.

What will become possible?</li><li name="25b2" id="25b2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Do you have monitors in the office with product metrics?

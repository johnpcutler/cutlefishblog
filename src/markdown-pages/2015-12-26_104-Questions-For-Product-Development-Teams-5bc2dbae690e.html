To quote <a href="https://medium.com/@joshelman/a-product-managers-job-63c09a43d0ec" data-href="https://medium.com/@joshelman/a-product-managers-job-63c09a43d0ec" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">one of my favorite posts on the role of product management</a>, the product manager’s job is to:</p><blockquote name="a76a" id="a76a" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Help your team (and company) ship the right product to your users</blockquote><p name="7c5c" id="7c5c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Simple right? Hardly. I like to think that product helps the team (both the immediate “doers” and the broader team) achieve a state of Flow for the benefit of your company and users. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29" data-href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Wikipedia defines Flows as</a>:</p><blockquote name="da89" id="da89" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">… the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_state" data-href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_state" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">mental state</a> of operation in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity.</blockquote><p name="a5fb" id="a5fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Apathy, boredom, and anxiety are Flow anti-patterns. Clear goals, tight feedback loops, and the absence of blockers are Flow state prerequisites.</p><figure name="3347" id="3347" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 400px; max-height: 234px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 58.5%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*h332lIEr3yb8sR3R.jpg" data-width="400" data-height="234" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*h332lIEr3yb8sR3R.jpg"></div></figure><p name="6e4a" id="6e4a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">And they also happen to fit squarely in a product manager’s job description. In short, help the team focus all of its energy on driving value directly to the users/customers. Do “everything else”. And do so in situations that are often ambiguous and constantly changing. Servant leadership (without the authority) at its best.</p><p name="ab67" id="ab67" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Below I have documented 104 questions (@250 if you count the questions inside the questions) that I ask myself during an average day, week, month, and year. They revolve mostly around the internal facing role of product and promoting Flow. For some of these questions, it is my responsibility to have the answer. The team deserves no less. For others, I guide the team towards self-discovery. Either way, the focus is on clarity, and a clear path forward.</p><h3 name="ee99" id="ee99" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Team and Situation</h3><p name="8e0a" id="8e0a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">What must I know about the team and situation before we really get started?</p><ol class="postList"><li name="ea81" id="ea81" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">How experienced is the engineering team? How familiar is the team with the problem domain? How motivated is the team to address this problem?</li><li name="c1ec" id="c1ec" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Can we co-locate the team? If not, does the team have a strong track record of working remote, and are they committed to overcoming remote challenges?</li><li name="7fd9" id="7fd9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Is the team comfortable with ambiguity?</li><li name="a40e" id="a40e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Does the team want to be involved in the more strategic aspects of the effort? If so, what is their background in assumption/hypothesis driven development?</li><li name="06ca" id="06ca" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Is the team comfortable interacting directly with end-users and customers?</li><li name="9524" id="9524" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Is the team empowered to solve the problem autonomously? Is there typically a lot of healthy debate and push-back? Or is the team eager for someone else to make the difficult decisions?</li><li name="c0a9" id="c0a9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Does the team possess a good mix of viewpoints, backgrounds, and communication styles? Or do some team members exert a disproportionate influence?</li><li name="1fa7" id="1fa7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">What is the history of the team? Are they coming off a positive experience with high momentum, or a negative experience with no momentum?</li><li name="7887" id="7887" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">What is the history behind this effort? How has that history shaped current perceptions? Is this viewed as an “about time” project, or a “why the hell?” project? Have other teams failed? Why? If building on top of an old feature, why was the feature left in the current state? How will it impact the bottom line? Where is the product in the product lifecycle?</li><li name="8a71" id="8a71" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Who are the major stakeholders? How do the stakeholders view the problem? Have they already become emotionally attached to potential solutions? Am I already biased? What is the general consensus on the risks involved? Are there any agendas at play? If so, what is our plan to navigate individual agendas?</li></ol><h3 name="25c7" id="25c7" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">Goal And Vision</h3><figure name="ec0f" id="ec0f" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--h3"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/55fqjw2J1vI?feature=oembed" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><p name="2e42" id="2e42" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">What is the big picture?

Does the vision inspire and focus our work? Can it be explained in a tweet? What is our “true north” ? Is the team engaged?</li><li name="3a18" id="3a18" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">As we discover new information, have we refined the goal appropriately?</li></ol><h3 name="af47" id="af47" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">Problem</h3><p name="4bb8" id="4bb8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">What problem are we trying to solve?</p><figure name="2e89" id="2e89" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HiB9L3dG-Aw?feature=oembed" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><ol class="postList"><li name="0df5" id="0df5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--figure">Does the team have a shared understanding of the problem we are solving? Are we speaking the same language? Does the team have a shared understanding of the problem’s root cause?</li><li name="46f1" id="46f1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Do we understand who we are solving the problem for? What are their needs? In their words, how do they describe those needs? Have we sufficiently researched our customer goals and pain points, including speaking directly with a minimum of ten customers (ideally with the team)?</li><li name="8194" id="8194" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">How are customers solving the problem right now, keeping in mind that our biggest competition is often the status quo?</li><li name="1761" id="1761" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">How much time and resources do we have to solve the problem? Are we running out of either? Do we share a similar sense of urgency? Do we share a high level idea of what we’ll be doing in the next week, weeks, month, and beyond?</li><li name="f4ec" id="f4ec" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">How will we rightsize our solution to the problem at hand? At what point will the investment of more time and energy have a limited return?</li><li name="00d3" id="00d3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">If we are releasing a feature for an existing product, have we identified the feature as a basic must-have “table stakes” feature, a performance feature, or a differentiator? Have we validated this understanding, or are we operating with limited information?</li><li name="739a" id="739a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Who are the team’s go-to subject matter experts (SMEs)? Are they available?</li><li name="45ed" id="45ed" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Have we injected the necessary awareness of the market, competition, market, and legal issues into our understanding of the problem? If not, what is the next step to gather that data?</li><li name="515d" id="515d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Was the team involved in defining the problem? Do they feel vested and engaged? How can we help them become more vested and engaged?</li><li name="ff6f" id="ff6f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Would some reframing of our goals and/or KPIs allow us to more effectively understand the problem from the perspective of the business? If this is impossible, is the team OK with the ambiguity? Is this a leap of faith, or a hesitant nosedive?</li><li name="8fca" id="8fca" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">What would happen if we simply did nothing? Is that an option? Is there a possibility that the problem will solve itself, or the metrics will move without our intervention?</li><li name="13fd" id="13fd" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Have we framed the problem in terms of desired outcomes as opposed to possible solutions/features?</li><li name="09fb" id="09fb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Have we leveraged all of our available sources of data to understand the problem, current workarounds, customer behavior, and competitive options?</li></ol><h3 name="c413" id="c413" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">Assumptions and Hypotheses</h3><p name="5375" id="5375" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">What are our knowns and unknowns?</p><figure name="0db6" id="0db6" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jTmXHvGZiSY?feature=oembed" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><ol class="postList"><li name="02d6" id="02d6" class="graf graf--li graf-after--figure">What are our operating assumptions?

Who bears the possible burden of that risk? Which assumptions must we accept as givens, and which assumptions are open to testing and validation?</li><li name="1332" id="1332" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">What are the constraints to our solution? For example, do we need to use an existing technology framework? Do we have to complete the feature in time for an annual convention?</li><li name="d89d" id="d89d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">What parts of the solution are negotiable? For example, could we reduce the breadth of features to release more quickly?</li><li name="6683" id="6683" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Have we discussed our individual biases? How do these biases impact our view of the problem, and our attachment to our proposed solution?</li><li name="dce0" id="dce0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">What is the current, single greatest threat to the project’s success? How will we defend against that threat?</li><li name="50ba" id="50ba" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Assuming that “not delivering the intended value to the customer” is our worst case scenario, what steps can we take to make sure that does not happen?</li><li name="3e17" id="3e17" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">What is our biggest gap in knowledge at the moment? What do we need to learn now? What can we learn later? How can we learn quickly and cheaply?

Is it available? If not, how might we “purchase” that information by committing our resources?</li><li name="5a46" id="5a46" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">What is the current working hypothesis in terms of a solution? Is there consensus among team members regarding our working hypothesis?</li><li name="e607" id="e607" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Was the team involved in generating the list of key assumptions, questions, and solution hypotheses? Do they feel vested and engaged? Did the whole team have an opportunity to state key assumptions impacting their area of expertise?</li><li name="f9df" id="f9df" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Could some of our questions be resolved by simply having clearer goals?</li><li name="1f97" id="1f97" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">We likely will need to function amidst some level of ambiguity. Are we potentially overreacting to, or under-reacting to the perceived level of ambiguity?</li><li name="dd01" id="dd01" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Have we agreed on a process to track and iterate on our assumptions, risks, and questions?</li></ol><h3 name="3c53" id="3c53" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">Prioritization, Sequence, Delivery</h3><p name="98f2" id="98f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">How do we do the most important thing next?</p><ol class="postList"><li name="1c95" id="1c95" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Does the team have a shared understanding of our current priorities, and our near-term prioritization and sequencing of work? Are we in agreement that this is the best plan of action?</li><li name="7919" id="7919" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Is the sequence of how we intend to release our solution optimized for information gathering?

How will we make these decisions? Are we about to make any irreversible decisions, and if so, do we agree on the potential risks involved?</li><li name="5e90" id="5e90" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Is there consensus around which decisions can be deferred?</li><li name="1eac" id="1eac" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">How will we decide which features are truly essential?</li><li name="fb56" id="fb56" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Is the team comfortable with the rough sizing (estimation) of prioritized items?</li><li name="cd3e" id="cd3e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">How will we decide that we’re done?

Must we validate how we intend to launch the feature?</li><li name="7008" id="7008" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Was the team involved in prioritizing work and developing the guidelines around how work was sequenced?

He’d do a take, and stop, and then get an idea from what had just gone before, and elaborate on it, or say to the keyboards ‘play this sound.’ One thing fed the other. It was a process, a kind of spiral, a circular situation. The recording of Bitches Brew was a stream of creative musical energy. One thing was flowing into the next, and we were stopping and starting all the time, maybe to write a sketch out, and then go back to recording. The creative process was being documented on tape, with Miles directing the ensemble like a conductor an orchestra.</blockquote><p name="5591" id="5591" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The point I’m making with these examples is that process itself is not the problem. Trying to demonize the concept of a series of steps towards an outcome is like calling breathing an anti-pattern. Calling it by some other name: craft, practice, “way of working”, method, and ritual is more palatable for the process phobe, but we often are discussing the exact same concept.</p><p name="9a78" id="9a78" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Thinking on the examples above, a good process …</p><ol class="postList"><li name="471a" id="471a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Represents the current tactic with full knowledge that the tactic may change</li><li name="d3ab" id="d3ab" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Attempts to eliminate individual biases and groupthink</li><li name="c909" id="c909" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Allows us to reflect on what is and isn’t working using both qualitative and quantitative data</li><li name="1219" id="1219" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Allows for iteration</li><li name="d40c" id="d40c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Is explicit and transparent … everyone knows what we’re trying to accomplish, minimize, and maximize</li><li name="b090" id="b090" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Encourages variability and conformance when it is most valuable</li><li name="7836" id="7836" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Engages the participants and players in an inclusive fashion by harnessing them as sensors and actors</li><li name="9bc7" id="9bc7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Is repeatable relative to the diversity of inputs and desired outputs</li><li name="7a94" id="7a94" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Does not usurp and try to control the collective intelligence of your team</li></ol><p name="4e73" id="4e73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">I’d like to end by discussing discipline and process. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4QEASusC-c" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4QEASusC-c" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Alistair Cockburn has a great YouTube video on disciplined Agile</a> which inspired this line of thinking.</p><p name="4923" id="4923" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We often equate discipline and process with rigidity. It just sounds inflexible. Cockburn claims that “lazy Agile” is surprisingly effective, but that we can do better by exploring different methods, and processes. Yes this discipline has more “process” (a couple more box and arrow diagrams), but it is no less (and perhaps even more) “Agile”.</p><p name="14a0" id="14a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A disciplined approach can be extremely flexible (you don’t see MMA fighters throwing up their hands due to the variability of their opponents). And the disciplined team — just like the disciplined improv group — knows when to break the rules and explore a new process.</p><p name="6a72" id="6a72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The truly agile organization resists the temptation to oversimplify. Like surgeons with their checklist it evolves processes to de-bias decisions and applies discipline (the good kind) and process where it will have the most leverage. This approach empowers all layers of the organization to experiment with and evolve the current tactic while making the tactic transparent and explicit. When modifying open source code we check out the “code” (the process), iterate, and check back in improvements for testing. It is egalitarian but disciplined.</p><p name="a83a" id="a83a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In closing, I’d encourage readers to define and practice process (under the guise of any word, really) in a way that generates results and introspection for your team and organization.</p><blockquote name="4234" id="4234" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler <br>Albert Einstein</blockquote><blockquote name="d8a0" id="d8a0" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote graf--trailing">I wouldn’t give a fig for the simplicity this side of complexity but I’d give my life for simplicity on the far side of complexity <br>Oliver Wendell Holmes</blockquote></div></div></section>

I turned around today to realize that I just published my 45th Medium Post.

Some of it is crappy. Some of it is inspired. Typos. Angst. I’ve done it all.

But there has been something very meditative about sitting down and cranking one or two out each week. It has helped ME clarify my point of view.

Given that Medium doesn’t have a great index feature, I figured I’d provide one here. I’m grateful for the folks who have taken the time to read and comment.

I grapple with what defines a sales-driven organization


> Prioritize the curb-appeal of your product over long-term customer value. For example, you actively build and sell flashy features which provide limited lasting value or fail to deliver on the sales promise.#### [43: Real World Kanban (A Cartoon)](https://medium.com/p/real-world-kanban-a-cartoon-116fd37f14ac)

What do most Kanban boards look like?

#### [42: Your Product is a Service…](https://medium.com/p/your-product-is-a-service-f70d92b7e992)

Your product isn’t confined to what you ship. Your product is the whole organization


> Product is not something you “ship”. Increasingly, it is a service that the whole organization *delivers continuously*![](/images/1*22kk91DZxJKFScCMRQr98A.png)

#### [41: Go Towards The Discomfort (It’s A Sign)](https://medium.com/p/go-towards-the-discomfort-its-a-sign-21ce4b1a8cc5)

I partner with my friend Claire to dig into life’s tough decisions. And why we should, as a good heuristic, do things that are uncomfortable


> It’s human to buckle, and it’s human to take uncomfortable risks. It’s also human to delude yourself, but also human — and possible — to [get to yes with yourself](http://www.williamury.com/books/getting-to-yes-with-yourself/). We are simultaneously creatures of habit and creatures of insight.#### [40: 100 Product Development Hats](https://medium.com/p/100-product-development-hats-7fabbded6b8d)

Product is to blame when sales attempts to sell “outside the box”

Sometimes what makes sense doesn’t make sense …

#### [36: Opening Your Eyes to Real Customer Delight](https://medium.com/p/opening-your-eyes-to-real-customer-delight-80e3a883bd93)

We often rationalize sub-par customer feedback. What do delighted customers look like?


> I’d argue that many of the product metrics we capture (e.g. engagement, conversions) are proxies for less tangible things like customer delight, advocacy, and product focus. The hard metrics can be used to predict churn and trial conversions, but they fail to cut at the central question: Is our product truly inspiring our customers and kicking ass?#### [35: Stop Setting Up Product Roadmaps To Fail](https://medium.com/p/stop-setting-up-product-roadmaps-to-fail-3189452360a3)

Are you trying to please everyone? Are you nimble enough to move/pivot if you need to?

#### [30: Decision Making Transparency (The Why)](https://medium.com/p/decision-making-transparency-the-why-7f90e48fded)

Explaining why you’ve made a decision is often more important than explaining the decision. The “what” may change, but the motivations remain powerful …


> In the swirl of growth, it’s easy to confuse and conflate transparency on the decision making process, with transparency on actual decisions and details.
> The Why is scalable because it carries the original intent of our decision, and not just the tactic.#### [29: 12 Core Competencies For Product Managers](https://medium.com/p/12-core-competencies-for-product-managers-8d5744f91bd)

> In my view we’re asking the wrong question. We’re replacing a tough discussion of values and principles — as a whole team, not just as product managers — with discussions about titles, job descriptions, the org chart, and handoffs. The best perspectives on product development [have nothing to do with defining and boxing a title](https://medium.com/@stewart/we-dont-sell-saddles-here-4c59524d650d#.w2rffmxtb).#### [16: This PM Hack Saved Me 1 Hour A Day (and helped me connect with more customers)](https://medium.com/p/this-pm-hack-saved-me-1-hour-a-day-and-helped-me-connected-with-more-customers-fbbb76c2ba2d)

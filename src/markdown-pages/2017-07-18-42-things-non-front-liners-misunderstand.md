It is unfair to expect people who haven’t worked on the front lines in software development to *just get it*. Just as, I’m guessing, it is hard for developers and UXers to grok sales and marketing, being a CEO, and working in HR. Assuming malice is a big mistake. We all want great outcomes for our respective businesses, but have a hard time bridging the divide.

I’ve offered up 40 or so based on my conversations with developers, designers, UXers, data scientists, customer support, and product managers. Of course … “it depends”, and none of these apply everywhere.

#### **Please add more!**

### **Non-Front-Liners routinely …**

1. **Underestimate** the cost of multitasking and context switching
2. **Underestimate** the cost of increasing complexity (adding use-cases, capabilities, etc.)
3. **Underestimate** the benefits of regular refactoring, investing in tooling, and allocating time for unstructured research/experimentation
4. **Underestimate** the investment required to build (and maintain) a meaningful level of shared understanding
5. **Underestimate** the value of iterating immediately (not months later) based on actual customer usage and feedback
6. **Overestimate** the value of “divide and conquer” models whereby individual teams have limited contact with other teams that are contributing to the same initiative
7. **Overestimate** the value of having managers/proxies communicate between teams (vs. having the teams communicate directly)
8. **Overestimate** the value of centralizing/sharing certain functions (e.g. QA, DevOps, UX)
9. **Underestimate** the value of committing later to work (e.g. acting on new information, not pre-committing resources)
10. **Underestimate** the value of more unstructured hacking/spiking to fully grasp the magnitude of a new challenge
11. **Underestimate** the cost of isolating individual team members on distinct “projects” to boost utilization rates (vs. having more slack time, and focusing on fewer initiatives)
12. Underestimate the cost of having single architects who “decide everything” in isolation, thereby removing front-liners from the decision making process
13. **Overestimate** the value of segregating front end and back end developers
14. **Overestimate** the value of using artificial deadlines to motivate employees
15. **Underestimate** the cost of leaving known bugs/defects active in product
16. **Overestimate** the value of extensive pre-planning without individual contributors (the people who will do the work) present
17. **Underestimate** the value of spending time “away from keyboards” (e.g. visiting customers, team white-boarding, etc.)
18. **Underestimate** the cost of preventing developers from using their tools of choice. The flip-side might be overestimating the value of consistency in tool selection.
19. **Overestimate** the ability for customers to describe what they need, and what they might find valuable
20. **Underestimate** the value of connecting new developer hires with the broader business context (e.g. invite them to sales calls, the customer support queue, etc.)
21. **Underestimate** the cost of becoming emotionally attached to high-fidelity mock-ups
22. **Underestimate** the value of unbiased coaching and facilitation
23. **Underestimate** the value of co-location and underestimating the cost of mixed-location (having some people co-located, but others remote)
24. **Overestimate** the value of adding process when an environment features low trust/low safety
25. **Overestimate** the value of having experience in a specific language/domain (of course, sometimes this is very valid)
26. **Underestimate** the value of working horizontally across a problem space (vs. going deep component by component)
27. **Underestimate** the value of live pattern libraries
28. **Underestimate** the cost of celebrating silver bullets when the work required corner cutting and is obviously “for show”. **Overestimate** the value of success theater
29. **Underestimate** the value of giving a team autonomy over its work environment and providing dedicated spaces to meet/work
30. **Underestimate** the cost of having a system that is too complicated for any one person to understand/explain
31. **Overestimate** the value of measuring a team solely based on story point velocity
32. **Underestimate** the interest developers have in understanding the business/customer problem (and the value that might afford to the company)
33. **Overestimate** the value of addressing team conflict via 1:1s (vs. coaching the team to resolve its issues publicly)
34. **Overestimate** the ability for a single product manager to correctly predict the future
35. **Underestimate** the value of connecting work to high-level business outcomes
36. **Underestimate** the cost of having inconsistent environments for QA, Staging, etc.
37. **Underestimate** the cumulative drag created by a “brilliant” executive who exhibits toxic behavior. Underestimate the costs required to insulate that behavior from the rest of the organization (and the efficacy of those efforts)
38. **Underestimate** the degree to which certain incentive structures can create conflict between team members
39. **Underestimate** the cost of coherence issues (e.g. actions running counter to stated company culture or goals)
40. **Underestimate** the value of divergence early in an initiative. Our tendency is to prematurely converge and “get moving”
41. **Underestimate** the cost of making individual promises to customers around compliance and security (vs. global policies)
42. **Overestimate** the degree to which developer “touch time” impacts the total lead time for initiatives (a value of 40% is good, 10–15% typical)
Here’s what would be awesome… if together we could amass a compendium of “**things Non-Front-Liners routinely underestimate and overestimate when thinking about software product development**”. I think this format works, and would help us stay consistent:

* Underestimate the cost of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
* Overestimate the value of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
My goal here isn’t to rant, but rather to build bridges and shared understanding. Let’s keep comments short and concise, with a focus on benefits to the business.

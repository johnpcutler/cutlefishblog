Shared with my team the other day in Slack …

**Why we write tickets**

* So if we get sick, a teammate can help us out
* To help us decompose our work into small pieces
* As a placeholder for a real-life conversation
* To keep track of how we resolved the issue
* To make our standups effective
* To point out dependencies
* To reflect on the mix/makeup of our work during retros
* Self-discipline. Don’t take on too much. Try to do one thing at a time
**Why we DON’T write tickets**

* To track our time
* To compete with other team members
* To show managers we’re busy
* To make managing people possible
* To report status, or % complete
* Because Jira is fun to use
* External discipline

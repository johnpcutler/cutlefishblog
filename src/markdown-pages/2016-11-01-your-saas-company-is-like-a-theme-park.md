I’ve been toying with metaphors for a SaaS company. The more I mull it over, the more SaaS companies start looking like service companies (or “experience companies”). Products are touchpoints, and the whole complex system is evolving and changing. Traditional product discovery methods aren’t well suited to the non-linear nature of the system.

How about a Theme Park?

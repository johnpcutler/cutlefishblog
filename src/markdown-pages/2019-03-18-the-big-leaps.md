My usual list-compulsion. This time…the big leaps I observe teams taking in their product development related continuous improvement journey

* Fully cross-functional teams (w/dedicated team members including UX and testers)
* Teams have direct access to customers/users
* Team operates as a team (not a work-group, many teams of one)
* Opportunity focused roadmap (vs. solution focused)
* Teams have direct access to insights/data
* Team able to link day-to-day work to core company bets (short/mid/long term)
* Design involved in opportunity and solution exploration/research
* Developers involved in opportunity and solution exploration/research
* “Non customer-facing” work viewed as equal to customer-facing work
* Products, capabilities, missions, and services over projects
* Embrace DevOps and related practices (e.g. CI/CD, trunk-based dev, etc.)
* Quality/craft is valued. Minimal amount of reactive/failure-mode work
* Value stream orientation vs. structuring around components, technology
* Team funded based on outcomes/capabilities vs. project completio
* Managers shift perspective to servant leadership — facilitators, coaches, catalysts
* Shift to smaller batches and more frequent integration/deployment
* Ability to run multiple, concurrent, context-dependent operating models across org
* Thoughtful approach to increasing organizational resiliency/adaptability/anti-fragility
* Shift from delivery stance, to learning/innovation/differentiation stance
* Balanced portfolio of bets. Risk and uncertainty exploited (not avoided)

![](/images/1*eyqvL2g6yFJY9J0k9s2awA@2x.jpeg)Software product development in the Agile/Lean style is counterintuitive until you’ve done it for a while (and even then it can throw you a curveball)

. You’ll get uncomfortable. You will persuade yourself that your company is unique, and that the patterns don’t apply.

But the patterns DO apply. To make meaningful progress, you must take **three foundational leaps of faith**.

Because the benefits accrue over time, you will *need lots of faith* (especially early on). The danger is hitting a pothole, and slipping into a local maximum. Often the answer is to get *more* uncomfortable — shorten the iteration, lower WIP limits, and have the tough conversations. It’s hard. No amount of rationalizing or “hey, [some company] does it” will prepare you.

*It starts with…*

#### Working more closely together…

Cross-functional teams, team goals (vs. individual goals), closer collaboration, full team retrospectives, fewer handoffs, greater autonomy, mentoring and coaching, need for psychological safety, large-scale kaizen events, swarming on impediments

*Working together let’s you…*

#### **Work with smaller/less/fewer/lighter…**

Teams, tasks, classes and methods, batches of work, components, “slices” of functionality, planning inventories, experiments, features (for equal or greater benefit), work in progress/process, context switching and multi-tasking, process overhead, command-and-control, dependencies, constraints

*Of course, when things are smaller you…*

#### Do things more frequently…

Show your work, refactor, get feedback from real customers, integrate, test, inspect and adapt, act on new learning, talk/pair/collaborate with teammates, deploy, review usage data, measure outcomes, stand-up, kill underperforming features, test new capabilities, realize benefits/outcomes, budget and finance, reallocate investments, run continuous improvement experiments

It is perfectly natural to feel incompetent, uncomfortable, bothered, pessimistic, and off-kilter. So the trick (to quote [*Modern Agile*](http://modernagile.org/)) is to make “safety a prerequisite”, and be prepared to get a little uncomfortable. Make it safe to take the leap of faith.

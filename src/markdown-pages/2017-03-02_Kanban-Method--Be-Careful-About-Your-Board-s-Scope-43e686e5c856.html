Where you are now might involve a broad sphere of interaction. Some examples might include:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="0a61" id="0a61" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">The availability of your UX resource is dictated by his involvement with other dev teams</li><li name="e5bd" id="e5bd" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Your team requires Ops involvement to deploy features to production</li><li name="16d6" id="16d6" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Far upstream, one of your team members is called on to provide an estimate</li><li name="72a6" id="72a6" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">A portfolio planning process “cues up” your next “project”</li><li name="da02" id="da02" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">UX “gets ahead” of some work</li><li name="ea01" id="ea01" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Far downstream, a customer provides feedback. Turns out you missed the mark</li><li name="3b94" id="3b94" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">You need another team to review your PRs to their service</li><li name="71be" id="71be" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Someone in procurement has to sign off on a contract for a new monitoring tool</li></ul><p name="ce83" id="ce83" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">For the systems thinkers among us, it can be tempting to push to visualize everything. Try it, and you’ll soon figure out the risks involved.</p><p name="12e9" id="12e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I remember the first time I walked over to an epic kanban board with a ball of string and some tape and added some portfolio planning steps to the left, a bunch of dependencies (with the string) to the middle, and some validation steps to the right culminating with “delivered desired outcome”.</p><p name="a664" id="a664" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A shitstorm swept in from across the building. What I added was technically correct — I was starting with what we did now — but seeing it up on the wall inspired some heated arguments. Down came the board.</p><p name="f745" id="f745" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why? In this case, the kanban board inspired some cognitive dissonance. It was widely circulated that front-line teams were “autonomous” and in full control of their destiny. The reality was a little messier. For example, there was an upstream analysis/validation phase that lacked visibility, and meant that teams were frequently surprised with new projects. The fact that this was happening was not a secret. But seeing it in all its glory got people fired up (both managers and engineers).</p><p name="0776" id="0776" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Organizations and individuals tend to assume a strange equilibrium around resource constraints, impediments, toxic people, inexperienced teams, handoffs, big batches, high utilization, and long feedback loops. There may be a gradual “drift into failure” (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Drift-into-Failure-Components-Understanding/dp/1409422216" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Drift-into-Failure-Components-Understanding/dp/1409422216" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">see Sidney Dekker</a>), but for the most part people pragmatically absorb the challenge. After a certain point, you stop making a fuss and do your best.</p><p name="eff5" id="eff5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">My advice is to be very, very cautious about boiling the ocean. Take small steps to indicate the dependencies while resisting the urge to visualize the work of other teams/individuals/resources. Figure out how to visualize points “off the board” (these can literally be nodes, lanes, stickies, etc.) without threatening people.</p></div></div></section>

* What you say, and how often you say it
* What, when, and how you celebrate
* The losses and missteps you acknowledge, and how you respond
* How you behave when the chips are down
* What you fight for at all costs
* The corners you cut
* Who you hire, promote, and compensate, and who you fire
* Who you “smoke out” until they leave the organization
* The worst behavior you accept and the best behavior you reject
* The voices you amplify, and the voices you suppress
* When you encourage conformity, and when you promote diversity
* How you handle disagreements and differences in opinion
* How and where you spend your time and money
* What gets discussed at the water cooler
* What gets discussed out in the open, and behind closed doors
* The contradictions you allow and the contradictions you stamp out
* The exceptions you make and the things that never budge
* Who sits together and how you arrange your office
* Who gets access to the best tools, technology, and infrastructure
* What you say about your customers during challenging situations

*Update: Great comments so far. Check them out.*

I need your help.

Please review the scenario below and answer the single question (below the scenario). You can reply using a comment here in [Medium](https://medium.com/u/504c7870fdb6), or reply to [*this tweet*](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/925140545839677441). Please resist the urge to critique or troll other answers. By narrowing the scope here, I am hoping to learn more about how people view the Product Manager role.

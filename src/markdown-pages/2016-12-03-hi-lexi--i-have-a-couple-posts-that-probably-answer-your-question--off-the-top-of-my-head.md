* Focus on challenges and needs **NOT** titles
* Treat teammates like creative makers **NOT** resources
* Provide context and data **NOT** solutions and platitudes
* Have suggestions and opinions **NOT** demands and fiats
* Be curious and open **NOT** dismissive and stubborn
* Harness diversity **NOT** conformity
* Embrace simplicity **NOT** oversimplification
* Deliver outcomes and impact **NOT** features and output
* Build less **NOT** more
* Be transparent **NOT** opaque or manipulative
* Be accessible **NOT** elusive or overbearing

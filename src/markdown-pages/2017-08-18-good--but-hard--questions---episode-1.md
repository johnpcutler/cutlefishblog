10. Are the right people talking?
11. Are our doors really open? Should they be?
12. Which voices should we be amplifying, but aren’t?

14. Where are we seeing hints of a possible future? Is it a good future?

26. In what ways do we encourage local behavior that is effective, but not in alignment with our global goals/needs?
27. When are we more than the sum of our parts? When are we less than the sum of our parts (we bring each other down)?
28. What are our most intractable problems? Why have we failed to make a dent in these issues? Why are they so stubborn?
29. Do we trust our immediate peers? Do we have confidence in their abilities?
30. Scale almost always causes entropy and an increase in complexity. How are we taming these forces?
31. Where is the good we must amplify?
32. Where are our strengths also our weaknesses?

34. What do we see that is difficult (or impossible) to communicate to our individual contributors?

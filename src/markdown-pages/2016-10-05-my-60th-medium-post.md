To celebrate my 60th post on Medium, I thought it would fun to just put them in one big list (ordered by views, descending). I was a guest on a podcast recently, and the host asked me how I managed to “write so much”. After mentioning some examples of people who write 10x as much, and with consistently higher quality, my answer was roughly:


> I write to wrestle with something. It’s my way of working through it. Sometimes the post will suck, or part of it will suck. I’m OK with that as it motivates me to keep on thinking through the problem.I’m honored to have folks wade through the good, bad, and ugly, and always appreciate feedback.

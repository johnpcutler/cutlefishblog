People are hired to support and manage it. Team members are hired to join X team. You start to see team-level roadmaps/backlogs. Now, small teams ARE good, they are, but the org wasn’t ready to support these teams, and in many cases the key driver was efficiency and cleaner meetings, not efficacy, customer value, and team autonomy.</p><p name="4caa" id="4caa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The big problem is that all this structure — the fiction of independent teams — actually makes it much harder to fix the underlying issues. It is intuitive, and solves short term pain, but it actually makes things worse.</p><p name="2b4c" id="2b4c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The “solution” isn’t necessarily to have 30+ person stand-ups (though that might be the right thing to do). But you need to keep people more fluid, and visualize the dependencies. Solid 2–6 month missions for 3–6 people, and then maybe reconfigure. Avoid locking down ideal structure before you ucan really support ideal structure. Swarm on the real impediments.</p><p name="66fd" id="66fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The important point is don’t create a fiction, and don’t prematurely optimize (or more like reactively optimize). If you do, you’ll be dealing with surface symptoms for a long time to come. Once the veneer is in place, it gets hard to really sense the real nature of the problem.</p><p name="3dc6" id="3dc6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Finally, if that 80 person meetings seems impossible — but it actually reflects reality, and you’ve tried to fix this with 12 managers with poor results — consider <a href="http://www.liberatingstructures.com/" data-href="http://www.liberatingstructures.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">liberating structures</a> and other approaches to have the big event occasionally.</p></div></div></section>

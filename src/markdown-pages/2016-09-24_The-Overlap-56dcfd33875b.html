Concurrently, we have seen a move towards <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">collaborative design</strong> — involving engineers and other stakeholders in the design process. These two factors have had a dramatic impact on how product development teams organize, work, and deliver value to customers. In this post I am going to explore some of these impacts.</p><h4 name="668b" id="668b" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">A Vignette From the Trenches</h4><p name="ef93" id="ef93" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Everyone is reasonably good at everything (except maybe Engineering, though some UX and Product folks have chops), and really good at some things…</em></p><p name="6fbf" id="6fbf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">First, let me paint a picture based on my career and recent personal experience. Imagine a team with a UX researcher, UX designer, product owner, engineers, quality assurance, customer success rep, and an agile coach.</p><p name="68f1" id="68f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They’re all in a van visiting a customer’s office. They’ve been spending the last couple days engaged in various activities: design studios, customer journey mapping, user story mapping, listening to customer interviews, and building a backlog of experiments to run.</p><p name="3061" id="3061" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The walls back at their office are plastered with artifacts…stickies from a <a href="https://hbr.org/2007/09/performing-a-project-premortem" data-href="https://hbr.org/2007/09/performing-a-project-premortem" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pre-mortem</a>, <a href="http://jpattonassociates.com/the-new-backlog/" data-href="http://jpattonassociates.com/the-new-backlog/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a story map</a>, wireframes (drawn by everyone), and a <a href="https://leanstack.com/lean-canvas/" data-href="https://leanstack.com/lean-canvas/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lean canvas</a>. Everyone is engaged and contributing.</p><p name="bddd" id="bddd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The PO isn’t the single owner of the backlog (the whole team owns it). The UX designer isn’t the single owner of the design (the whole team owns it, and is reasonably design savvy as a whole). The PO isn’t the sole owner of defining the problem (the whole team explored it, with help from the UX researcher who did a deep dive a week prior).</p><p name="fc3c" id="fc3c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And the pairing! QA is pairing with UX to explore interesting edge-cases. An engineer paired with the customer success rep to analyze existing customer data. And the UX researcher paired with the product owner and another engineer prior to the effort to do some preliminary research.</p><h4 name="7032" id="7032" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">That Sounds Batshit Crazy</h4><p name="9cfe" id="9cfe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">This only happens in the movies… As a designer this would drive me crazy …Can’t they just write a spec?</em></p><ul class="postList"><li name="d77e" id="d77e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Sound terribly inefficient?</strong> Perhaps, though we are chasing efficacy and outcomes and the madness addresses these goals remarkably well</li><li name="66a0" id="66a0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Sound impossible without a ton of resources?</strong> Probably, if you only just hired your first UX designer</li><li name="6fc3" id="6fc3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Sound completely foreign, and you have a tough time believing things actually function this way? </strong>It’s rare, but this is how some of the best cross-functional product development teams operate now (2016)</li></ul><h4 name="5541" id="5541" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">PUX</h4><p name="0452" id="0452" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The product owner gets their world rocked…</em></p><p name="f763" id="f763" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The role that has been most impacted by these shifts <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">is the product owner</strong> role. No exaggeration, but my role recently as a UX researcher (at a West Coast, recently IPOed SaaS company) was nearly indistinguishable from what I <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">used </em>to do as a PM/PO a decade ago:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="d874" id="d874" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">User stories?</strong> Yup, as an output of facilitated activities with the team.</li><li name="5e51" id="5e51" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Deep customer/user research?</strong> Yup, prior to and during the initiative.</li><li name="1336" id="1336" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Measuring the impact of the initiative?</strong> Yup, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Our UX folks and product owners have such an overlap of responsibilities and skills, that it is difficult to keep everyone engaged. I almost feel like a new role or title is in order. Sure, the PO does some of the tactical record-keeping stuff. They do the status checks and keep me informed. But the reality is that this team could run well without one (a PO).</blockquote><blockquote name="e89c" id="e89c" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">My challenge is that we have already established these structures. I can’t just say “don’t work”. I have people to engage. I want them to share in the excitement. But in some cases their getting overwhelmed by all of these very experienced people</blockquote><p name="e924" id="e924" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">This isn’t an environment that an associate product manager will navigate with grace. It’s hard. It has become a game of who can contribute valuable context and skills to the soup. A pure meritocracy. The customer needs no representation because the customer is literally on the phone and the team is decently skilled at asking the right questions. Heavy prioritization is unnecessary because the team is moving quickly enough to try new things (with real customers) at will.</p><p name="ed61" id="ed61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One major factor here is the rise of UX. The UX tool chest has always been broad (research, validation, iteration, etc.). They just didn’t get a chance to flex their muscles until recently. Turns out designers make great sensemakers and untanglers and know a thing or two about customer value. Throw in collaborative design, and suddenly your engineers are a bunch of entry level UXers and product owners. Cool huh?</p><p name="1e5b" id="1e5b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Which in turn impacts the product owner. The formulaic “1 PO per one or two teams” starts to feel very archaic. In its place we ask “what do we need, and who can provide what we need?”:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="8897" id="8897" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">If in-depth data science is required, we should find a data scientist</li><li name="1808" id="1808" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">If coordination with the marketing team is required, we should find a coordinator</li><li name="7217" id="7217" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">If more context is needed about the business objective, we should find a business analyst</li></ul><p name="987c" id="987c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">You get the idea. To be valuable, product owners must leverage differentiated skills. My prediction: the product owner/product manager titles will morph as new, more specialized roles march to the trenches. <a href="https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/the-evolving-product-manager-role-6f288bbc3cda" data-href="https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/the-evolving-product-manager-role-6f288bbc3cda" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">I have a simple table describing how I see the product manager role evolving</a>.</p><h4 name="d0f5" id="d0f5" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The Clan</h4><p name="dfe5" id="dfe5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Where do I belong?

You go back to home base to recharge. Your services are “loaned out” (or even billed out, in some cases) to these teams. It’s a services model. Engineers form the nucleus, and you swoop in when you can to help out.</p><p name="1985" id="1985" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Things are different with these <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newLDR_86.htm" data-href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newLDR_86.htm" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">highly formed, normed, stormed, and performing teams</a>.

They’ve called you out in a retrospective for slacking. You made up, and formed a stronger bond after the rift.</p><p name="6b1b" id="6b1b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The matrix is hard. It is made <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">much harder </em>when you are fully embedded on a team. It’s almost not a matrix anymore, except for the pesky question of who gives you your marching orders to a new project, a raise, promotes you, and coaches you. Is it the people who have contact with you day to day? Or the whole network of coordinators and managers who exist to keep the whole matrix pumping?</p><p name="caee" id="caee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The services model brand of matrixing has given way to being fully embedded. Everyone is invited to the retrospective. Which ironically has made things much more confusing.

Reflecting on the last couple years I can say, without a doubt, that pattern libraries are one of the core components in this new reality. To achieve any level of consistency in the midst of all this independence and autonomy, you’ll need more than weekly design reviews. Things are moving too fast for consistency to take work. Consistency needs to be automatic. A solid <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">live </em>pattern library also empowers rapid prototyping and collaborative design. If using the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">right </em>pattern takes any extra work, then the wrong pattern will hit production.</p><p name="fa66" id="fa66" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Simply put, getting the plumbing straight for this needs to happen.

It’s personal in the sense that I represent the personality type I’m about to describe. It’s something I’ve come to peace with over the years but the road has not been easy.</p><p name="51d1" id="51d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For the purpose of this post I’ll call the archetype <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">STCA (</strong>Systems Thinking Change Agent). It’s weird, I know, but it’ll have to do and I’ll explain more below. I was tempted to call it just a Change Agent —the post definitely has a change agent angle — but that wouldn’t fully describe the personality.</p><p name="0ddb" id="0ddb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For some perspective, when I was in 2nd grade I played the part of the “Eternal Question” in our blockbuster play <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Vernacular Island</em>.

For you, thinking this way is unavoidable</li><li name="4efb" id="4efb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">care deeply about people and don’t like to see them frustrated, thwarted, tense, stressed, or manipulated. This impacts you on a visceral level, you internalize it, and you take on these struggles as your own</li><li name="b942" id="b942" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">have a growth mindset, and assume a growth mindset in others. <a href="http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2015/11/16/growth-mindset-clearing-up-some-common-confusions/" data-href="http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2015/11/16/growth-mindset-clearing-up-some-common-confusions/" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">A growth mindset is</a> “the belief that qualities can change and that we can develop our intelligence and abilities.” You assume (often incorrectly) that people are open to change, receptive to constructive feedback, and able to follow your logical reasoning and change direction as quickly as you</li><li name="4e04" id="4e04" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">are passionate about the truth and discovering root cause (and various techniques to do this).

If so, maybe you have some shades of STCA-ism.</p><h3 name="1307" id="1307" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Pitfalls</h3><p name="1367" id="1367" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">As a STCA, sooner or later you’ll stumble into the following pitfalls. I know because at some point or another I’ve been there. With the best of intentions you go with your gut, lay it on the line, and things don’t end up working for whatever reason.</p><p name="59ca" id="59ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">You’ll mistake people listening to you for people supporting you. </strong>Most people are eager to hear new ideas and fresh perspectives… to a point. They might even thank you for “challenging [their] thinking”. But this doesn’t necessarily equal support or a willingness to act on that feedback. At a certain point it becomes “too much” and the mood shifts from openness to rejection and annoyance. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Solution:</strong> Don’t assume listening correlates with support. And don’t assume — especially with email — that the lack of response equates to tacit understanding.</p><p name="7db2" id="7db2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">You’ll quickly find allies but you’ll overestimate the number of people who really care.</strong> Being vocal tends to attract likeminded people. Assuming that this sample is representative (at least in terms of how much they care) can be a costly mistake. Odds are that you’ve probably made contact with the minority of people who both notice and care enough about the issue. That doesn’t mean there aren’t others sympathetic to your effort (there most certainly are) but you can’t expect people to take too many risks. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Solution:</strong> Don’t count on reinforcements until after you’ve reached the tipping point.</p><p name="a323" id="a323" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">You’ll assume others care as much as you do (and care about the same things).</strong> “Care” is a loaded word. We’re conditioned to equate care with virtue, and may even consider ourselves virtuous for caring about or advocating for something. But people are wired in different ways. I know plenty of people who care deeply about certain aspects of work (e.g. the money, the facilities, the brand of coffee) but could care less about things like customers, culture, priorities, or ways of working. This doesn’t mean they wont express some passing interest in those topics, but rather that when the chips are down they’ll pass. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Solution:</strong> Don’t use your level of concern or values as the benchmark. If anything, underestimate interest and intent.</p><p name="33ab" id="33ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">You’ll misunderstand “how things actually work”. </strong>Like most systems,<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> t</strong>he deeper story for an organization is rarely evident on first blush, and certainly defies value statement platitudes and the recruiting sales pitch. It can’t be fully understood by looking at an org chart, and can be difficult to triangulate by talking to a handful of people. Who really calls the shots? What do people really care about? What happens to people who question the status quo? What is the “real” culture? <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Solution: </strong>Use your systems thinking hat! Make a concerted effort to <a href="http://blog.strategyzer.com/posts/2015/10/13/the-culture-map-a-systematic-intentional-tool-for-designing-great-company-culture" data-href="http://blog.strategyzer.com/posts/2015/10/13/the-culture-map-a-systematic-intentional-tool-for-designing-great-company-culture" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">map organizational dynamics</a>. Carefully observe to understand the culture as expressed through actions. Be honest about what the status quo optimizes for and whether that is conducive to your proposed change.</p><p name="ebd2" id="ebd2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">You’ll think you’re the only one to notice the problem.</strong> It’s easy to assume that the problem is obscured and if people could SEE the problem they’d be open to fixing the problem. More likely, the problem is clear and known to a more people than you’d think. Some are playing the long game (see below). Some people don’t really care enough to cause a fuss. Some people have alternative interpretations and/or political motivations. Don’t talk yourself into the “problem evangelist” role. It’s a losing game. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Solution:</strong> Test for how other people perceive the problem. Test for their current tactics and approach. Then find a way to test whether you can enlist support.</p><p name="34b3" id="34b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">You’ll misunderstand why other people are not speaking out.</strong> Your fellow change agents all may have similar motivations, but you may find yourself being the most vocal representative. Why? They know something you don’t know or sense something you don’t sense. It’s important to understand and respect where they’re coming from. They may have tried getting into the ring at some earlier point and were knocked out. Accept that this puts you in a somewhat precarious “kill the messenger” position. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Solution:</strong> Empathy and understanding. Seek to understand their resistance to being more vocal. Try to distribute the pressure for change among more people.</p><p name="46d9" id="46d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Your motives will be misunderstood. </strong>Push beyond a certain point and you’ll be easily branded as a “too negative” or “only talking about problems”. Don’t be so quick to discount this feedback as you’d likely do the same thing if the tables were turned. Recognize that you’ve likely amped up the intensity level as you try to push through resistance. You’re responding to resistance, they’re responding to intensity, and so it goes. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Solution: </strong>Do whatever possible to avoid the downward spiral. Be especially descriptive about your motives (building trust, continuous improvement, positive change, etc.)</p><p name="a02f" id="a02f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">You’ll get caught playing the short game.</strong> Some people play the short game and go down in a blaze of glory (or with luck into a lightning victory). Others methodically play the long game, chipping away at structures, forming alliances, and forging change. If you play the short game then you have to understand the risks involved (an organism attacked rejects threats). This may be fine — life is too short to continue doing something that brings you down — but realize what you’re getting into. And don’t judge the “long gamers”. It’s an individual decision. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Solution:</strong> Decide in advance whether you are willing to play the price for playing the short game. It’s a gamble. To quote Kenny Rogers:</p><blockquote name="c896" id="c896" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">You’ve got to know when to hold ‘em<br>Know when to fold ‘em<br>Know when to walk away<br>Know when to run</blockquote><p name="7897" id="7897" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">You’ll overestimate the power of bottom-up change. </strong>Bottom-up change is extremely difficult. <a href="http://www.craiglarman.com/wiki/index.php?title=Larman%27s_Laws_of_Organizational_Behavior" data-href="http://www.craiglarman.com/wiki/index.php?title=Larman%27s_Laws_of_Organizational_Behavior" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">At a certain point you hit the glass ceiling of established systems and structures.</a> After any period of time those structures become rigid, self-perpetuating, and extremely difficult to “nudge”. Even Herculean individual efforts fail here. So be prepared. Consider the long game. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Solution: </strong>Be honest with yourself about the feasibility of bottom-up change. Work tirelessly to influence someone with the power to enact far reaching change. Consider the long-game.</p><p name="a61f" id="a61f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">You’ll assume that people have the same change vision.</strong> Even in cultures that stress continuous improvement it is common for individuals and groups to jockey for ownership of change efforts. On the surface you may see openness to change. But if you peel away the layers you’ll find competing visions for change. Realize that people may agree that change is required, but be split on tactics. In my experience this is the norm. The problem typically isn’t the problem, but rather the competition for who solves it (and how). <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Solution: </strong>Map the various efforts to address the problem. Understand who shares your perspective. Understand where there is tension.</p><h3 name="be9f" id="be9f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Now What?</h3><p name="dd87" id="dd87" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I’m the last person to suggest that you become someone who you aren’t. The first thing to realize is that your experience will be highly org/culture specific. This is absolute key to understand. For most STCAs there is no reigning us in. It’s an ingrained mindset. Finding the right culture and environment is key.</p><p name="c1aa" id="c1aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Much of what you read online about change is written from the perspective of consultants and managers. This is top-down and outside-in change and not bottom-up change. But resistance is resistance, and it will always be a factor. The reality is that from this vantage point you’ll do no good winning even the majority of hearts, unless they care very, very deeply about the cause. The only path to success — and remember that SOME people are able to be successful — is through a disciplined tightrope walk. Without that, you may even succeed in terms of getting the ball rolling, but you’ll have a miserable time of it.</p><p name="48cc" id="48cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The hardest thing for STCAs to come to grips with is that politics, influence, and maneuvering are requirements for change in most orgs (short of an all out revolt, or mass exodus). You don’t have to be disingenuous, but you will have to work the people angle.</p><p name="95d0" id="95d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Assume that everyone is “on the same side”, but don’t assume deep trust from the outset. Probe, test, observe, map, and ask questions. Understand the resistance on a deep level before confronting it. Spend time with people who don’t share your mindset. Slow down to speed up.</p><ul class="postList"><li name="50df" id="50df" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Develop a clear vision and boil it down to its essence</li><li name="c1e3" id="c1e3" class="graf graf--li graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--li">“Be the change” in whatever way possible.

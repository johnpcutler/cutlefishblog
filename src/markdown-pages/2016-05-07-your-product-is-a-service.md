What is **The Product?** What is ***Your* Product?**

![](/images/1*rJm3ADtiBS27b7tqmiVm1A.png)

Your **Product** is …

* Every prospect/customer interaction and touchpoint
* Every interface, application, bit, byte, atom, and circuit
* The collective learning of your organization
* Your ads, brand communication, press, and social media presence
* Your content, the words you use, the emotions you evoke
* Your sales methodology, emails, calls, and visits
* Your help documentation, customer support, and webinars
* Your post-sales/onboarding experience. Your billing department
* How you treat the customers you lose, and the prospects that say no
* Your code quality, data-centers, infrastructure, and test coverage
* The worst behavior you tolerate on the part of your leadership and team

Product is not something you “ship”. Increasingly, it is a service that the whole organization *delivers continuously. *Tossing things over the wall isn’t going to cut it. Dividing up your organization will restrict the flow of valuable information. Aligning yourself around anything other than the end-to-end customer experience is a form of sub-optimization. Any poor user experience — using the software, on the phone with support, learning, buying, or renewing — can sink you.

So when folks go on and on about defining product management … ask why? The product is everything. Don’t let the anchor of old ways of delivering physical software products weigh you down. You’re in the [service delivery and design](http://www.servicedesigntools.org/) business now. Embrace it!

There is simply not enough time in the day. And the multi-tasking would kill you.</p><p name="b9e2" id="b9e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And then you have the information that is deemed too sensitive or distracting to share. Where to draw the line is outside the scope of this post, but suffice to say there are always pieces of information that are too sensitive or risky to share broadly.</p><p name="39dc" id="39dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The reality is that our work lives are largely influenced by external factors. Decisions driving team changes, promotions, strategic shifts, project choices, and tool choices can have a dramatic impact on the lives of the various stakeholders. In an ideal setting these decisions would all be “local”, but that is rarely the case.</p><p name="5d27" id="5d27" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the swirl of growth, it’s easy to confuse and conflate transparency on the decision making process, with transparency on actual decisions and details. The former is powerful and engaging. The latter is so frequent that it’s impossible to keep up. But it is easy to conflate the two and assume that both are impossible.</p><p name="6a27" id="6a27" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s not impossible. Communicating the decision framework starts with some fundamental questions …</p><ul class="postList"><li name="260d" id="260d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Who makes the decision? Who is impacted?</li><li name="3972" id="3972" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">How is the decision currently made (factors, timing, process, etc.) ?</li><li name="e1bd" id="e1bd" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">What are we attempting to maximize and minimize with our decision?</li><li name="d839" id="d839" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">What is our path for continuous improvement with this decision making process?</li></ul><p name="ba3e" id="ba3e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">The last two points are critical. We typically frame important decisions based on hierarchy … with the “decider” holding the power (and responsibility), and those impacted playing a receiving role. It is unidirectional.</p><p name="4b02" id="4b02" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Consider a different perspective …</p><p name="059a" id="059a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Answering these questions takes work. But it scales remarkably well.</p><p name="dedf" id="dedf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Those impacted by decisions are often the best to determine whether those decisions were effective. Did we realize the desired effect? How can the decision making process be improved in the future? This is the “Why” that people most crave. The Why is scalable because it carries the original intent of our decision, and not just the tactic.</p><p name="eab8" id="eab8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When people advocate for transparency, what they typically care about is not knowing every detail. We quickly realize that’s impossible. But rather they care about understanding how and why the decisions are made, and how and why they can participate in iterating on the actual solution.</p><p name="15e7" id="15e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We trust others to make decisions. And they trust us to make decisions.</p><p name="c562" id="c562" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And then we enter into a partnership to continuously improve on those decisions.</p><p name="9e33" id="9e33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">It’s the combination — trust and collaboration — that turns the typical hierarchal decision making model into a partnership. And that lets information sharing scale.</p></div></div></section>

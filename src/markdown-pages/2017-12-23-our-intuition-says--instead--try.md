When you’ve seen something work, you tend to view it as more “intuitive”. It’s easy to forget how *counterintuitive* it might have felt initially. Below is a quick brainstorm on areas where our intuition may lead us astray.

#### When we encounter drag with software product development…

### Our Intuition (Often) Says… — > Instead Try…

* Optimize work assignments — > **Pair and mob more**
* Try to “catch up” — > **Do less**
* Don’t interrupt the team — > **Show work to customers more often**
* Better estimates — > **Work smaller**
* Lengthen sprint — > **Shorten sprint**
* Keep people busier — > **More slack, lower optimization**
* More prescriptive stories — > **Build shared understanding (together)**
* Plan ahead — > **Limit planning in progress (PIP)**
* Senior devs “crank out hard stories” — > **Senior devs pair and teach**
* “Better mocks” and pixel-perfect designs — > **UX/DEV pairing and pattern libs**

* Deliver individual “parts” — > **Individual thin slice across the whole**
* Success theater to “save face” — > **Make it safer to acknowledge challenges**
* Amplify what is broken — > **Amplify what is working**
* Add a layer of management — > **Build team self-sufficiency with coaching**

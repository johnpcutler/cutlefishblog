…and why you may be asking the wrong question(s)

The topic comes up most often when trying to define roles and responsibilities, and workflows (e.g. how early should Person-Team-Functional Group X get involved with Initiative Y).</p><p name="b1c6" id="b1c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It dawned on me the other day that these conversations are often missing the point…they’re avoiding the elephant in the room. It is easy to talk about handoffs and make broad “build the right thing” vs. “build the right thing right” proclamations, and much harder to ask:</p><blockquote name="dffd" id="dffd" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Is it working?</blockquote><p name="8d41" id="8d41" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Because when you boil the issue down, there is typically a lack of confidence regarding outcomes. The whole discussion is a proxy.</p><p name="3a6c" id="3a6c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yes, sometimes I do hear someone say:</p><blockquote name="d424" id="d424" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">You know, our company knocks it out of the park every frickin’ time. We’re doing amazing work. I see the value my work brings to humans every day. I just wish I had a little more say in how we solve the problems.</blockquote><p name="9a83" id="9a83" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">…but this is very, very rare, and most often in the healthy context of someone trying to craft (or advance in) their personal career.</p><p name="9f58" id="9f58" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So what happens is that you get into elaborate debates about frameworks, process change, methodologies, the org chart, and the history of certain roles (e.g. “well design has always been ….”). Instead of stating bluntly:</p><blockquote name="d423" id="d423" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">I’m all for solutions, but our solutions could be better.</blockquote><p name="a59a" id="a59a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Or</p><blockquote name="3edc" id="3edc" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">You are an awesome subject matter expert, but a not-so-great designer</blockquote><p name="f1e0" id="f1e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Or</p><blockquote name="1c9c" id="1c9c" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">I really respect your sales skills, but I have a bit more practice in conducting ethnographic research</blockquote><p name="dd60" id="dd60" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Or more personally…</p><blockquote name="60d5" id="60d5" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">I’m not sure you know/respect the depth of my expertise in this area. Sometimes I feel my contributions are diminished. I’m sure this is unintentional. I’d love to talk to you more about [some area of expertise]</blockquote><p name="d49e" id="d49e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The proxy discussion <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">misses an important point</strong>. Great solutions require diverse perspectives, experiences, expertise, and collaboration. Dividing up the organization into problem framers and problem solvers isn’t a great long term tactic. It may help in the short term — but you’re chasing a local maximum in terms of generating outcomes.</p><p name="6266" id="6266" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why? Firstly, the vast majority of problems are nested solutions/tactics to a higher level problem. Unless the “problem” you bring to the team is “long term financial success of the organization”, there will always be a network of assumptions around causality, impacts, etc. So problem statements tend to be constructs that prematurely narrow the solution space, and can obscure the real impact of the work. Four lines of code can be a “problem” and a solution. A four year strategy can be a problem and a solution. No matter where you are operating, you’ll want to link the work to the highest level goals of the organization.</p><p name="5b7d" id="5b7d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Second…why is it best to send people off into their respective corners? You’re avoiding really learning how to work together, to share data/context, to respect areas of expertise, and to exploit healthy creative tensions when they arise. This is HARD WORK, and not something you can represent with a RACI diagram (shudder). What would it take for a problem framer to contribute to a solution, but saunter away when they had nothing valuable to add? Or for a senior leader to swoop in to add valuable data, but do so in a way that was not inadvertently intimidating, or creativity sapping (the accidental HIPPO).</p><p name="8864" id="8864" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So… short post here, but here’s the gist:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="b705" id="b705" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Make safety a prerequisite. You’ll need it to have the tough discussions.</li><li name="c39b" id="c39b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Then, try to have the real discussion about whether things are working. Don’t get bogged down in the theoretical proxy discussions. Reflect deeply and honestly about outcomes.</li><li name="ecb3" id="ecb3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Then, have the discussion about what areas of expertise are necessary to improve those outcomes, respecting the fact that not everyone will know exactly what you do, or what you can offer (and vice versa). Consider also that you don’t need to be an expert to be able to contribute value. For example, business-non-designer-types can contribute great data in co-design activities, provided they realize that they probably aren’t contributing the end-solution.</li><li name="2367" id="2367" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li graf--trailing">Then, figure out how to really work together such that it amplifies those skills, shortens feedback loops, and allows people to contribute at the right time, and in the right capacity. And figure out a way to strike the fine balance between push and pull involvement, knowing full well that this will vary by effort.</li></ol></div></div></section>

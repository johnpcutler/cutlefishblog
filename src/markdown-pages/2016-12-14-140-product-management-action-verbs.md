I enjoy brainstorming words. It’s a weird habit. When describing our work, we often talk in platitudes. Words jog our memory, and force us to think about what we need and don’t need. What do you need? Do you need things that inherently clash? Who can realistically do what?

Here is a [Google Sheet with the list of words](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WHptwdv8uH_AJAgyptCCZFYSiLlj6eBV_qgkrUtZnA8/edit?usp=sharing). Might be interesting to look at your PM job descriptions, and see how these line up. Or revisit your resume.

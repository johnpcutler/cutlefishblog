He likened a recent success in swarming on an opportunity as an example of “building trust in something new and risky” (actually, he used the example of lifting your hands off of the steering wheel of a self-driving car). The car thing really got to me.</p><p name="f9a2" id="f9a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">For some reason this helped me crystalize something that has been bothering me for years now.</strong> When the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">new and risky</em> is grounded in first-principles (limiting WIP and prioritizing by high cost-of-delay), you’ve got a problem. Even more importantly, when visualizing work — which in my mind involves absolutely no value judgements — is considered “sensitive”…wow, you’ve really got problems!</p><p name="f670" id="f670" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We’ll put things on linear calendars with dates and fanfare, and call our estimates commitments…but a program level board is considered heretical. Daggers!</p><p name="a8f9" id="a8f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Aside … I always love when a leader marvels at the benefits of focusing (and the teamwork that inspires), and then promptly returns to “business as usual” (with all the work they paused AND the new work) and expecting the same outcomes.</em></p><p name="165d" id="165d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m overreacting. But let me explain…</p><p name="6b38" id="6b38" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Kanban doesn’t care about how you write code, structure and incentivize teams, develop roadmaps and backlogs, manage projects, manage people, scheduled meetings, or release software. Through visualizing our work, Kanban helps guide our continuous improvement efforts.</p><p name="30d2" id="30d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You could argue however that there may be some values baked into “slow, gentle, evolutionary, incremental approach”, “respecting current roles”, “making process policies explicit”, and “improving collaboratively (using models &amp; the scientific method)”. Not to mention limiting work-in-progress and managing flow.</p><p name="dabb" id="dabb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What would the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">opposite </em>of these quasi-values look like? I dunno…</p><ul class="postList"><li name="bdba" id="bdba" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Bold and visionary decision making.</li><li name="6504" id="6504" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">No one gets in your way.</li><li name="380c" id="380c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Information on an as-needed basis only. Resist formalizing process.</li><li name="a44e" id="a44e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Managers own decisions related to process selection</li><li name="9f36" id="9f36" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Bite off more than you can chew. Stretch goals. Overcommit.</li><li name="c018" id="c018" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Optimize for resource efficiency, not flow efficiency</li><li name="6ac2" id="6ac2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">We value entrepreneurialism and individual action</li></ul><p name="2c02" id="2c02" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">If you can have an alternative narrative of “right”, then we have baked in values. Kanban (sort of) deals with this by:</p><blockquote name="a9af" id="a9af" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Respecting the current process, roles, responsibilities &amp; titles</blockquote><p name="5d6e" id="5d6e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Let’s say that in your company continuous improvement <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">on the program level</em> is a closed-door activity between senior managers…well, you just have another Kanban board in that room. Or perhaps you don’t want to codify the current real-world process. Well… your process could be as simple (and meta) as “no process defined, ask someone”. Maybe the CEO wants the power to move any card on the board. Add a simple “CEO can move any card in this column, and any column to the left of this column.” Of course she won’t want that to be made explicit, but that’s another story.</p><p name="4193" id="4193" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So we’ve dealt with transparency and collaboration (sort of). But you still have flow efficiency, limiting WIP, and evolutionary change. Changing these things might be tough given the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">current process</em>.</p><p name="0aa9" id="0aa9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">OK. Getting personal for a moment. I frequently get called out for having “strong opinions on how things should work” (mostly from managers and leaders). I’ll try to answer with something like:</p><blockquote name="b159" id="b159" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">I don’t really care about what happens as long as we can observe the system together (visualize work), talk about what is working and not working, ground what we’re doing in first principles, create an environment of psychological safety, and experiment and learn</blockquote><p name="d909" id="d909" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">In my mind, this is about as reasonable as you can get. I deeply, deeply believe in these things. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">But it is very much guided by my individual value system</strong>. And I see other system-thinker “agile” types get caught up in the same trap. We believe we’re being insanely pragmatic and open, but it <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">sounds</em> insanely prescriptive and heretical.</p><p name="c052" id="c052" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So the important question when introducing Kanban into an organization is something along the lines of:</p><blockquote name="60dd" id="60dd" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">How do you approach continuous improvement on the individual level, team level, team of teams level, department, cross-department, and organizational level?</blockquote><p name="bab0" id="bab0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Most people have never even thought about it. “It just happens” or “we do it on a case by case basis” or “really, that’s a manager’s job” or “well, we do an employee survey quarterly” or “that’s what retros are for, right?” The real opportunities are frequently a step (or a couple steps above) the team level, but that realm is a murky mist.</p><p name="88f1" id="88f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Listen carefully. This is the root of the challenge. How does the group feel about continuous improvement? This is your starting point.</p><p name="396a" id="396a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have no grand conclusion other than that “meta processes” (things we believe carry no prescriptive qualities and just help us sense the problem) are often perceived as threatening and prescriptive.</p><p name="6eea" id="6eea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Cheers!</p></div></div></section>

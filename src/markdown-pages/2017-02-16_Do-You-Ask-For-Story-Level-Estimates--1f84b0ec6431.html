The ID and researcher see some UX complexity and suggests the team might want to try a couple versions of the flow with real customers and a working version. The lead engineer doesn’t expect any surprises unless they hit a known limitation in the current API . Both agree that they would be surprised if it took &gt;5 months to successful iterate towards a viable solution (less than 10% chance).

Before adding a new process / working agreementâ€¦

Look for these warning signs and antipatterns:

* Good for the part, but not the whole?
* Addresses symptoms, not problem?
* Treats problem as local when global? Global when local?
* Makes work (and the flow of work) less visible?
* Solves multiple needs suboptimally vs. better spot solutions?
* Makes identifying key constraint(s) more difficult?
* Obscures economic trade-offs?
* Fundamental attribution error? Over-indexes on individuals
* Efficiency at the expense of efficacy?
* Predictability at the expense of beneficial variability?
* Trace-ability at the expense of outcomes?
* Limits flow/quality of information? Lengthens feedback loops?
* Limits valuable conversations/interactions?
* Difficult to observe/sense impact?
* Intentionally opaque to avoid harmful micromanagement?
* Not valuable to customer? Not valuable to team?
* Removes a valuable forcing function?
* Reduces decision transparency/quality?
* Not safe to fail? Wide blast radius. Non-reversible.
* Reduces psychological safety?
* Trust proxy?
* Proxy metrics?
* Drives a wedge between groups/individuals?
* Perverse incentives?
* Driven disproportionately by short-term needs?

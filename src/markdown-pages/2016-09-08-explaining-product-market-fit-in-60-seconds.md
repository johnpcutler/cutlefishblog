#### Your product shows potential. But does it perform?

Product/market fit is a slippery term. I think of it as follows (3Ps):

![](/images/1*Q4ql8AqNvIIuGpKgDicMjw.png)

#### Pain

You’ve validated a **pain** exists and an identifiable group of people are willing to fork over cash to see that problem fixed

#### Potential

Your product shows **potential. **That group of people want to give your product a shot. They’re willing to engage with your product/organization in the hopes that it will solve their pain.

#### Performance

Your product **performs**. It actually solves / alleviates the pain. It produces valuable outcomes and *continues* to produce valuable outcomes month after month, year after year. You continue to innovate on your solution to the problem/**pain**, and realize the **potential**.

This is why Product/market fit is fluid and hard to pin down, especially when you’re tackling ubiquitous problems.

1. **Pain **is relatively easy. Most pains are known (though some discover pains we didn’t even know we had).
2. With some work, teams can develop products that show **potential**. It’s harder, but doable. The deeper the pain, the more people are willing to take chances on things with potential. Especially in tech, a lot of companies are throwing around money just to try things out.
3. **Performance** is where things get tough. The rubber hits the road.
The danger is **mistaking pain and potential for performance**. Pain and potential can get you reasonably far, certainly past a couple rounds of funding. But it all eventually boils down to performance. Large swaths of startup technology hasn’t advanced beyond the potential phase. Which is OK — there might be a huge upside — but it is what it is.

The lesson: **differentiate product potential from product performance** when talking about Product Market Fit.

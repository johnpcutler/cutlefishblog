Some quick thoughts on continuous improvement experiments.

### Opportunities

* Encourage divergence when “casting the net” for opportunities
* Resist imposing one “version” of what better (and progress) looks like
* Map the relationships between opportunities. Be skeptical of “one root cause”
* Converge on common needs, salience, momentum, and potential impact
* Consider doing nothing. “What would happen here if we did nothing?”
### Experiments

* Don’t abuse the word “experiment” to force and manipulate
* Engage the whole team in brainstorming possible experiments
* Create a backlog of experiments, but limit experiments in progress
* Engage the whole team in the design of the experiment
* Remind people that “failed” experiments offer valuable learning
* Openly discuss how the experiment might backfire. Invite skepticism
* Discuss steps to guarantee the experiment is safe
* Timebox the experiment. Use constraints creatively
* Make sure you’ll have access to data…don’t hoard data
* Commit to reflect on the experiment regularly
* Amplify what works. Dampen what doesn’t
* Rinse and repeat

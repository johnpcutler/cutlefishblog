Quick post to get back in the swing of things after a much needed vacation.

When I talk to startup product development teams, I listen carefully for people saying things like:

* We’re real \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ nerds
* We are experts at \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
* We live and breath \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
* Our team’s secret weapon is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
* We consistently find a way to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
* At the core, we’re here today because \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
If I hear people provide specific, non-plastic responses, my ears perk up.

Luck, first-mover advantage, funding, and connections can get you pretty far. But to win (and continue winning) you need to be awesome at *something. *That something can be a variety of things—networking, raising money, technical/ux/product chops, knowledge of a certain buyer pain, marketing creativity, etc. — but it **needs to be repeatable and intentional.**

Startups often fall into these traps:

* They’re **scattered**: they want* *to be awesome at everything
* They’re **conflicted**: they try to be awesome at things which are in direct opposition
* They’re **delusional**: they make bold, aspirational claims about things that they aren’t, frankly, awesome at
* They’re **myopic**: they make big bets on being awesome at things that don’t really matter, and don’t give them an edge
* They’re **self-conscious**: they don’t want to admit what they’re actually good at because it isn’t sexy, “cutting edge”, etc.
These traps lead you down a slippery slope: ignoring and failing to double down on what you’re actually good at and failing to become awesome at what you need to be awesome at.

So, take a moment to answer:

What must we be awesome at?

What are we awesome at?

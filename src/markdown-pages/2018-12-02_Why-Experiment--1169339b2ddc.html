We’ll have 100% confidence and certainty! No more guessing! No more arguments! We’ll be using science…no more <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/10/26/data-driven-decision-making-beware-of-the-hippo-effect/#72110a7a80f9" data-href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/10/26/data-driven-decision-making-beware-of-the-hippo-effect/#72110a7a80f9" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">HiPPO decision making</a>!” This manifests in seriously dysfunctional behavior: cherry picking experiments/data, ignoring all qualitative data, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3204791" data-href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3204791" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">p-Hacking</a>, data-hoarding, slipping into local maximums, and flawed experimental design.

They’ve got reasons. Their “n” is too small. They can’t afford data scientists and data engineers (or their data scientists are too busy). “Experimentation is too expensive and takes too long!” Their problem space is not A/B or multivariate testing-friendly. They’ve committed to features on the roadmap. They’ve talked themselves out of experimenting, and in so doing, sadly, they’ve talked themselves out of being curious, learning, and taking calculated risks in their context.</p><p name="d21e" id="d21e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For these two types of organizations, we find four things missing:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="9f37" id="9f37" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Viewing experimentation as a catalyst for learning</li><li name="f2b4" id="f2b4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Building a foundation of trust and safety</li><li name="3354" id="3354" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Embracing uncertainty</li><li name="164b" id="164b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The need for Minimally Viable Experimental Rigor (MVER)</li></ol><p name="ef7b" id="ef7b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">They’re stuck in what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Khvf1oExds" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Khvf1oExds" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Doc Norton brilliantly describes</a> as the implementation mindset (“get it right”) vs. the experimentation mindset (“explore different ways”).</p><h3 name="5929" id="5929" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Horses for Courses</h3><p name="0db7" id="0db7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Experiments come in many forms: randomized controlled trials, natural/quasi-experiments, observational studies, and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">gasp</em> ‘just trying stuff.’ Trial and error with completely random inputs is very rarely how humans solve problems. <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2012/10/how-do-children-learn-so-quickly-bayesian-statistics-and-probabilities-help-nate-silver-and-kids.html" data-href="https://slate.com/technology/2012/10/how-do-children-learn-so-quickly-bayesian-statistics-and-probabilities-help-nate-silver-and-kids.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fascinatingly, children learn using a Bayesian approach</a> (exploring the “balance between ‘priors,’ the beliefs [they] bring to a problem, and data”) and in some cases, “kids understand the probabilities of possibilities better than adults do.”</p><p name="73b1" id="73b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In complex systems with lots of moving parts, our “experiments” are more like <a href="http://cognitive-edge.com/methods/safe-to-fail-probes/" data-href="http://cognitive-edge.com/methods/safe-to-fail-probes/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">safe-to-fail</a> interventions.

Business is strategic gameplay and rarely resembles a brute-force optimization problem (e.g. increase avg. shopping cart $ size with 2px rounded button corners) or a lab setting. The winners can exploit this uncertainty for competitive advantage. They learn faster, reduce the cost of being wrong, make lots of reasonably informed (but not perfect) decisions, and exploit asymmetric opportunities.</p><p name="1359" id="1359" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Most importantly, they are asking the right questions — resisting the urge to rigorously optimize for X (e.g. tackling the “leaky top of the funnel”) without questioning whether X is the right “play” from a business gameplay perspective (the end of the funnel represents a viable, defensible business). At a high level, the experimentation is focused, appropriate, and grounded in sound product development strategy, vision, and gameplay.</p><h3 name="f664" id="f664" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Yes, It’s “Significant”</h3><p name="6002" id="6002" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The stalwarts of massive-scale controlled online experiments — Google, Amazon, Netflix, Facebook, AirBnb, Intuit, etc. — <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3063846/why-these-tech-companies-keep-running-thousands-of-failed" data-href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3063846/why-these-tech-companies-keep-running-thousands-of-failed" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">offer many, many valuable lessons</a>. No doubt, they are impressive in their ability to experiment at scale and generate outcomes in their respective contexts. I’m also impressed by my friend who recently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Mechanical_Turk" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Mechanical_Turk" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mechanical-Turked</a> an “AI powered” application approval idea at his B2B SaaS company, and started earning revenue (and learning a ton) in three days. Somewhere, out there, is a team trying something new this week/month, be it a design sprint with participatory design, trunk-based development, usability testing, or maybe a new retrospective format. All experimentation, but not formal experiments.</p><p name="107a" id="107a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Creative Selection: Inside Apple’s Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs</em>, Ken Kocienda explains Apple’s version of “experimentation”:</p><blockquote name="4a60" id="4a60" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">We always started small, with some inspiration. We made demos. We mixed in feedback. We listened to guidance from smart colleagues. We blended in variations. We honed our vision. We followed the initial demo with another and then another. We improved our demos in incremental steps. We evolved our work by slowly converging on better versions of the vision. Round after round of creative selection moved us step by step from the spark of an idea to a finished product.</blockquote><p name="8f0b" id="8f0b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">This is not Netflix-esque controlled experimentation, but it still captures the experimentation mindset beautifully. It’s the curiosity, testing, repetition, and refinement that truly counts.</p><h3 name="c690" id="c690" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Better Products</h3><p name="b5af" id="b5af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">So, what does this all have to do with Amplitude and product analytics? At Amplitude, our mission is to help our customers make better products. Our customers come in all shapes and sizes. Yes, some customers run concurrent large-scale controlled growth experiments, and we welcome that. Others (Amplitude included) may use historical regression, target and elicit qualitative feedback from beta customers, and sometimes (gasp!) “just try stuff” when the decisions are reversible, and/or the problem is complex. The crux here is 1) are you learning, and 2) are you turning that learning into a better product.</p><p name="e8a7" id="e8a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We run North Star Metric and Customer Journey workshops with our customers to help keep their eyes on the prize instead of on red herrings and vanity metrics.

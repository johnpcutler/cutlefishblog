Obligatory image … so that Medium recommends the post.I hit a goal of sorts today: 175 posts on product development. Actually… the goal was 150, but I was having so much fun I forgot about the challenge to myself in my notebook.

A big thanks to the folks who check out the posts. Your comments, recommendations, and reads have kept me motivated. Over the last 18 months of writing, I have learned a ton about myself. Some recent posts — [The Product Of You](https://medium.com/p/the-product-of-you-d672fb22eb6e), and [To the Drifters, Makers, Why-Askers, and Systems Thinkers…](https://hackernoon.com/to-the-drifters-makers-why-askers-and-systems-thinkers-d6bf4991dd9) — have represented shifts for me personally. I have come to accept more about who I am, where I thrive, and how I’d like to create impact. And that is due in no small part to the awesome product development community here on Medium, and on Twitter (@johncutlefish). Thanks again!

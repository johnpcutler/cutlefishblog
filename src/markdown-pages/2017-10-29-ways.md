I have been thinking about *ways *lately, mostly because I seem to be having *way*-debates/conversations/misunderstandings multiple times a day on Twitter. I’ve also come to realize that using certain *way*-names like Agile, DevOps, Lean, etc. can lead to terribly unproductive exchanges. Few people share the same mental model, and some people are extremely vested in specific interpretations.

![](/images/1*EpPGIGljhP2Ynt-yWi9XMA.jpeg)Talking WaysI’m also very passionate about the usability of *ways* and words (which is highly related to learning and service design). A lot of the “thought leader” chatter and maneuvering has absolutely NO bearing on the user population(s)

 and better outcomes. It is theoretical masturbation, one-upspersonship, territorial marking, and thinly veiled marketing.

So, to better understand these dynamics, I brainstormed a bit on *ways*.

### Some Thoughts On Ways

**Way(s):** Tool, method, methodology, framework, practice, skill, etc.

1. Any *way* can be knowingly/unknowingly abused, misused, and/or misapplied.
2. How a *way* is designed, taught, and introduced can improve/degrade its usability and impact.
3. Every instance of applying a *way* becomes a new (highly local) way.
4. *Ways* are built on many implicit and explicit assumptions and facts. The environment surrounding these assumptions and facts can change.
5. *Ways* are experienced by the humans involved and impacted. Experiences vary. These experiences are an extension of the *way*.
6. *Ways* are applicable within a partially explored universe of contexts.
7. Gauging the applicability of a *way* to a particular context, often involves *ways*. Some *ways* are used (primarily) to select the “right” *ways.*
8. Most *ways* are retroactively codified. The practice precedes the labeling.
9. Most *ways* emerge from multiple earlier *ways*.
10. *Ways* are constantly evolving, and spawning/inspiring new *ways*.
11. When is a heavily adapted/modified *way* a new *way*? This can be a difficult (and contentious) question to answer.
12. As *ways* evolve, they grow, divide, swallow up other *ways*, experience entropy, and shift original boundaries. *Ways* may cease being useful, relevant, or understandable/describable.
13. *Ways* “in practice” may differ from *ways* “in theory” (for positive and negative effect). There is a constant tension between theory and practice.
14. *Ways* practiced “to letter” may differ from *ways* practiced “in spirit”. The degree to which modifications are acceptable/encouraged/expected, can be unclear to different actors.
15. Learning a *way*, often starts with learning a simplistic/prescriptive version of the *way*. There will likely be limits to the introductory version of the *way*.
16. The simplistic/prescriptive version of the *way *will feel overly simplistic/prescriptive to experienced practitioners. The reductionist version also tends to predominate mainstream perception.
17. Improving how we use *ways* involves adaptation and improvisation.
18. We mix, match, and invent *ways* to solve complex problems.
19. To use a *way* successfully, it isn’t always necessary to understand how/why the *way* works. But when things don’t go as expected, or we reach a local maximum, this knowledge can help.
20. Two *ways* can achieve the same impact/effect when applied to the same problem.
21. Learning, teaching, and adopting *ways* often involves *ways*.
22. Most *ways* require some prerequisite knowledge and/or a prerequisite state.
23. *Ways* overlap, contain, belong to, are shared by, reference, and are dependent on other ways.
24. It can be hard to capture the “state of the art” of a particular *way*. Somewhere, the *way* has been up-leveled (frequently combined with other *ways,* and sometimes by accident).
25. Ecosystems emerge around *ways*. The actors in these ecosystems have a range of complimentary, adjacent, and competitive needs. *Way* ecosystems also overlap, compliment, and compete.
26. When demand is high, there will be financial incentives to sell, rebrand, repackage, re-invent, oversimplify, over-sell, and control *ways. *It can also be lucrative to shape the discussion on provenance, lineage, and “credit”.
27. Individuals who anchor their careers around specific *ways*, will be biased to solve problems using those specific *ways*
28. We seek *ways* that provide certain and “simple” fixes to our challenges. Easily solved problems will rarely provide the buyer/user with a competitive advantage (but may provide an immediate improvement)
29. *Ways* that are widely sold and packaged will require a certain amount of standardization and simplification.
30. A perfectly executed *way* may still result in failure. A poorly executed *way* may result in wild success.
So that’s what I came up with. I am sure I’m missing a ton here. Any help is appreciated….

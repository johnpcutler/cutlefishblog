What strengths will you leverage?</li><li name="5125" id="5125" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">You have a magic ball. Money is no object.

Why?</li><li name="7809" id="7809" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">A workaround is when you can’t initially get something done with the tools available, but you improvise and make things work.

What is important to you?</li><li name="1441" id="1441" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Most movies have that montage scene about 2/3rds of the way through when everything starts moving.

What is their job description?</li><li name="ab97" id="ab97" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">I’ve got ten cards here describing different things you can do with our product. Without saying anything — it’s best if we don’t talk, and remember you can’t hurt my feelings — I’d like you to draw a frowny face, smiley face, or a deadpan face on each card describing how you feel when you use that feature.

Why?</li><li name="17a7" id="17a7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">For most jobs you can let a lot of stuff slide in the short term. But there is something that simply MUST happen.

You are presenting to the whole company. You’re about to show the magic slide … the slide that rocks everyone’s world, secures your raise, and turns you into a rockstar. Can you draw it for me? What would it say? What are the three bullets?</li><li name="c427" id="c427" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">We’ve all witnessed purchasing fails over the years … that one software tool that got everyone super excited but then failed to deliver.

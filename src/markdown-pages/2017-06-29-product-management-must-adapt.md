I put together this leave-behind for a talk/training session. Medium doesn’t do tables, so the best I can offer is this image (and this [link to a pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B04yoW1JFDHGUTk2eTVuTU9vcDg/view?usp=sharing)).

What was the motivation for this compara-listicle? I keep seeing the same practices/approaches/words/ideas that “worked” for wrapped products being used for SaaS (Software as a Service). Considering that SaaS is almost geriatric by tech standards, this is highly disconcerting. Throw in IoT, ML, AI, Zero Interface … and that every service company is now a technology company … and you’ve gotta wonder “can we evolve?”. We’re driving the feature factory, and we have to stop.

Anyway … very busy the last two weeks, so apologies for not posting more.

Time. The product managers in his team were so overwhelmed with the day to day that they had no time to do this more proactive thinking. The leader was similarly overwhelmed. So they adopted a coping mechanism: big-bang quarterly planning, which in turn became so painful that no one wanted to do it more frequently.</p><p name="1613" id="1613" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My advice?</p><blockquote name="cb79" id="cb79" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p graf--trailing">If it is important, then do it. Ask each of your PMs to put 1hr on their calendar each week to work on it. Let them say no to something else (don’t expect them to work an extra hour). Make yourself available every two weeks to review the roadmaps…ideally as a group, so the PMs can learn from each other. In short, if something hurts (but is important), do it more often without overloading the team.</blockquote></div></div></section>

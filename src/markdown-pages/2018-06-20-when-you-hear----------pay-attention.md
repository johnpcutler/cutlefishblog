*Note: With dad-hood I’m doing more lists. They’re easier to write while learning to care for this awesome little farting/burping/pooping/smiling human. Apologies if you’re a fan of the longer posts. I’ll get back to them eventually/occasionally.*

#### A quick list of hints that there may be an opportunity for improvement (and/or that you’re about to fall into a trap and need to pay attention):

* Might as well do [some extra thing] while we [do the original thing]
* We don’t want to have to revisit [some decision]
* While we’re waiting on [some blocker], let’s start [something new]
* It would probably be more efficient if we ……
* It’s too early to [some interaction with users/customers]
* If we bundle these things together we will get [some efficiency]
* We don’t all need to be in the room for [some decision]
* We can “get ahead of it” by [a series of handoffs]
* Well [some person] is the only person who can do [some task]
* It doesn’t work now, but it will work when [some future task is done]
* We’ll have to wait on [some person] to make that decision
* It’s the right thing to do but [some excuse masquerading as pragmatism]
* We just need to “lock down” [some specification] and then we can……
* Just this one time lets [some cut corner] and then we’ll fix it, hopefully
* We need to do this to close [one deal]. But I’m sure it will apply elsewhere……
* Oh, this doesn’t need UX [or QA, Ops, etc.]
* So we have this [side project]…can you attend the meeting to [plan in secret]?
* Oh we can’t risk [trying some valuable goal]…
* Oh you can’t test [some feature] because [some perceived limitation]
* We need individual owners otherwise [some inability to track/punish]
* Well, we’re unique because [some non-unique challenge]
* This is too big for one sprint, so we’ll do phase one now and….
* I’m pretty sure I can represent the customer in this case…
* [Some effort] is too big to fail. We need to get this right…
* We need some quick wins because [normal wins take too long]
* I think we can parallelize [two related efforts]…
* And then [some other group] can maintain it, right?
My friend Jon Quigley and I are writing a follow up post with more explanation, but hopefully this is helpful in raw form…

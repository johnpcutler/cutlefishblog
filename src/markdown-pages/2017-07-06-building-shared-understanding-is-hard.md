![](/images/1*mB7S3wypuD9so6peD084mA.png)**We were aligned last week. And now we are not. What gives?**  
Correct. Building shared understanding is hard. And fleeting. You have to keep at it.

**Why are the on-boarding docs in Confluence out of date?**  
Because building shared understanding is hard. It takes work. If we can’t keep them updated maybe they are not important. Do you care?

**Do we really need another whiteboard session?**  
Yes. Building shared understanding is hard. It takes time.

**Why do we keep having to revisit the mission goals?**  
Because building shared understanding is hard. Especially when we’re gathering new learnings and information.

**Why didn’t they thoroughly read my Slack message?  
**Because Slack is a fire-hose. Building shared understanding is hard. Go for a walk and figure it out. Or advocate for a team agreement to read and comment on important Slack messages.

**The team is super busy. But we can’t seem to get anything done!**  
Right. Because the stuff that matters requires shared understanding. And building shared understanding is hard. When we sidestep the hard work, we end up doing the less consequential work.

**I can get so much done alone. People just slow me down.**  
There are certainly times for that. But if a team of five is to operate as a team (and not five teams of one each), then you have to build shared understanding. And that’s hard.

**Can we just write our standup updates in Slack each day?**  
Conversations are important. Building shared understanding takes cadence, adding new information, and confirming our understanding. Can you do that in Slack? Give it a try…

**What’s up with all the stickies? Can we get back to work?**  
Sure. Just make sure you are walking out of the meeting for the right reasons and not because building shared understanding is hard.

**I can’t get through to people.**  
Yup. Building shared understanding is hard.

**No one understands me.**  
I can relate. It’s hard. Start trying to build bridges. Build shared understanding.

**Why isn’t that [shared artifact] enough?**  
\_\_\_\_ is Hard. You may need more artifacts. Or more pairing on artifacts, and then throw them away once you’ve built shared understanding and captured that shared understanding in code and a usable product.

**But …**  
Building shared understanding is hard.

**…**  
Hard

### So ….. Do the work!

* High stakes horse trading and the rush of getting a big project “funded”
![](/images/1*w1Ldv_Z4uMgEs4P9IKl3nQ.png)* Heroic firefighting and thwarting impending disaster
* Being right. Having the “best idea”
* Getting the headcount during the annual planning process
* Closing the deal. Winning the bakeoff
* Confirming our belief that “all companies are fucked up”
* Shipping the silver bullet, and the success theater that follows
* Being the first person to use sexy new technology in production
* Saving the day with your genius commit
* Having a problem to fix. Being a “critical part” of the solution
* Fixing the problem you identified (regardless of whether it was the actual problem)
* Reply all
* The “crazy startup life” … things are “literally breaking apart before our eyes”
* Having everything under control. Knowing exactly what is going on
* Rocking the boat. Shaking things up. Gutting it. Starting it over
* Rewriting someone’s “crappy code”
* Saying no, because you can
* Beating the odds. Making the risky bet
* Exposing the flaw in someone’s reasoning
* Watching something implode, saying “I told you so”, and then fixing it
* Letting someone fail, and then taking their job
* Always being in the loop
* Navigating political intrigue, and amassing political capital
* Taking credit for a change initiative. Doing it your way
* “Crazy hours”
* Crazy output, flying, moving fast
* Nailing the deadline on the nose. “It came down to the final hour …”
* Making yourself indispensable in the new process
* Raising the profile of your effort/team/domain
* Forming a bond around mutual discontent. Complaining about ineptitude. Plotting
